4,,Preface,"The State Council of Educational Research and Training has developed the State CurriculumFramework - 2011 and Position Papers in tune with the National Curriculum Framework - 2005and the Right to Education Act - 2009.  Accordingly a new set of textbooks has been designed tobe introduced in a phased manner.  In the year 2012-13, the first of this series of textbooks wasdeveloped for classes I, II, III, VI, and VII. In the year 2013-14 for  classes IV, V, VIII and IXand for class X textbook  in 2014-15. Practicing teachers have been involved in the production ofthe textbooks along with the state level and national level experts.Hitherto, English was introduced in Non-English Medium Schools in class III.  The StateGovernment introduced English for the first time in class  I in 2011-12 in all Non-English MediumSchools also. In the year 2012-13, English has been introduced  in class II in all Non-EnglishMedium Schools. With this, all classes from I to X will have English as one of the subjects,irrespective of the medium of instruction. Therefore, in order to have parity among students ofEnglish and non- English medium, a common English textbook has been  introduced in all mediafrom June 2012. Moreover, since IT enabled learning, multilingualism, and language across thecurriculum would greatly enhance the child's learning, it would not be a problem for the non-English medium child to learn English as effectively as the child in English medium does. This singletextbook norm is already in practice in many states including Tamilnadu, Bihar, and Kerala. Further,students of all media have a common English Textbook at Intermediate level in our state.This textbook, “Our World through English” class X,  is an integrated one in the sense ithas the Main Reader component, the Supplementary  Reader component and the Workbookcomponent interwoven into a single textbook.  Hence, these components are found in each andevery unit.  The language skills  listening, speaking, reading, and writing are integrated in the largercontext of the themes as suggested in NCF - 2005. The activities are so designed as to ensure theholistic treatment of language.Inclusion of Gender Sensitivity and Child Sexual Abuse in School Text Books published bySchool Education Department with support of UNICEF is taken up to ensure protection of childrenthrough various interventions like personal safety rules, gender sensitivity, child sexual abuse, selfesteem and life skills. In these areas safety mechanisms and laws related to child protection aretaken care of. Hence, the teachers must know about these things and bring awareness among allthe stakeholders.The main aim of teaching English is to help learners evolve themselves as independent usersof English.  I hope this textbook will help teachers and students achieve this by making the teaching-learning process effective.I thank all the institutions and experts at the state and national level, the members of theTextbook Production  and Development Committees, the staff members of  the SCERT, T.S.Hyderabad and all others who have contributed directly or indirectly for the successful productionof this textbook.Any suggestions for the improvement of this book are welcome.DirectorSCERT.,  Hyderabad.27-11-2013HyderabadFree distribution by T.S.

13,,Attitude Is Altitude,"Imagine having no arms to stretch in the morning, to help you scratch that itch, to allowyou to wrap your arms around your loved ones. Imagine having no legs to kick pebbles downthe street, to walk or run, to bicycle or skateboard, or get you from point A to point B. Thenimagine both at once, which is what Nick Vujicic has faced his whole life. Have you heardsomething like this before?Nick Vujicic was born with no arms and legs - but he doesn’t let the details stop him. Thebrave 26-year-old — who is mainly a torso — plays football and golf, swims and surfs,despite having no limbs.Nick has a small foot on his left hip which helps him balance and enables him to kick. Heuses his one foot to type, write with a pen and pick things up between his toes.‘I call it my chicken drumstick,’joked Nick, who was born inMelbourne, Australia, but now livesin Los Angeles. ‘I’d be lost withoutit.’ 'He's very modest but he getsmarriage proposals from women allthe time,' said Nick's friend andpublicist Steve Appel, from LosAngeles. 'He would love to get marriedand start a family but he's waiting forthe right girl to come along.' Water sports aren't Nick's onlything - he also plays golf with a club4Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class Xtucked under his chin, and is a huge fan of the English Premier League.His parents decided not to send him to a special school - a decision he said was very hardfor him, but which may have been the best decision they could have made for him.When Nick was born his father was so shocked that he left the hospital room to vomit.His distraught mother couldn't bring herself to hold him until he was four months old. His disability came without any medical explanation - a rare occurrence calledPhocomelia - and Nick and his parents spent many years asking why this cruel trick wouldhappen to them. 'My mother was a nurse and she did everything right during pregnancy butshe still blamed herself,' he said.'It was so hard for them but right from the start they did their best to make me independent.’ 'My dad put me in the water at 18 months and gave the courage to learn how to swim.’'I also got really into football and skateboarding. I totally love the English Premier League.' Nick's father was a computer programmer and accountant and he taught his little sonhow to type with his toe at just 6 years old. His mum invented a special plastic device thatmeant he could hold a pen and pencil.Despite the risk of being bullied, his parents insisted Nick on attending mainstreamschool. 'It was the best decision they could have made for me,' adds Nick, who later achieveda degree in Financial Planning and Real Estate. 'It was very hard but it gave me independence.'Nick, who was teased and bullied, had an electric wheelchair for mobility, and a team ofcarers to help him. 'I was deeply depressed when I was eight years old,' he said. 'I went to my mum cryingand told her I wanted to kill myself.’'I felt cold and bitter. I hated God for doing this to me and was terrified of what wouldhappen when my parents weren't thereto look after me.’'I could brush my own teeth with awall mounted brush and wash my ownhair with pump action soap, but therewas so much that was impossible forme.' At age ten Nick tried to drownhimself in the bath but luckily the5Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class X5attempt was unsuccessful. 'I felt there was no purpose when you lack purpose and strength.It is hard to hold on,' he said. But with the help of his religion, friends and family, Nickmanaged to pull through to become an international symbol of triumph over adversity.'When I was 13, I read a newspaper article about a disabled man who had managed toachieve great things and helped others,' said Nick. 'I realised why God hadmade us like this - to givehope to others. It was soinspirational to me that Idecided to use my life toencourage other people andgive them the courage that thearticle had given me.’ 'I decided to be thankfulfor what I do have, not get angryabout what I don't.’ 'I looked at myself in themirror and said: 'You knowwhat the world is right that I have no arms or legs, but they'll never take away the beauty ofmy eyes.' I wanted to concentrate on something good that I had.'""The challenges in our lives are there to strengthen our convictions. They are not thereto run us over"", said Nick. In 1990 Nick won the Australian Young Citizen of the Year awardfor his bravery and perseverance.'And once I was in a car and a girl at traffic lights was looking at me interestingly. Shecould only see my head so I decided to do a 360 degree spin in the car seat to freak her out.Her face was like woooooooah what is going on? She sped off really quickly.'Nick began travelling the world and in 2008 he went to Hawaii and met surfing masterBethany Hamilton, who had her arm bitten off by a shark when she was 12.'She was amazing,’ said Nick. 'She taught me how to surf and I was terrified at first, butonce I got up there it felt absolutely fantastic and I caught some waves pretty well.' Nickquickly learned how to do the 360 degree spins on his board - a feat that got him on thecover of Surfer magazine within 48 hours. 'No one has ever done that in the history ofsurfing,' he said. ‘But I have a very low centre of gravity so I've got pretty good balance.’6Free distribution by T.S.

The football fan is now a motivationalspeaker and has travelled over 24 countries speaking to groups of up to 110,000 people. He moved to Los Angeles two years ago in 2007 and plans to continue to travel theworld.""If I fail, I try again, and again, and again. If you fail, are you going to try again? The humanspirit can handle much worse than we realize. It matters how you are going to finish. Are yougoing to finish strong?"" said Nick 'I tell people to keep on getting up when they fall and to always love themselves,' he said.'If I can encourage just one person then my job in this life is done.'- http://www.dailymail.co.uk1st July, 2009skateboard (n):a short narrow board with small wheels at each end, which youstand on and ride as a sportsurf (v):to take part in the sport of riding on waves on  a surfboardtorso (n):the main part of the body, not including the head, arms,  or legs           Nick‘s speech at a stadium                              Nick playing golfBody structure and looks are inborn.

14,,Every Success Story,
15,,Is also a Story of Great Failures,"Failure is the highway to success. TomWatson Sr. said, “If you want to succeed,double your failure rate.”If you study history, you will find thatall stories of success are also stories of greatfailures. But people don’t see the failures.They only see one side of the picture and theysay that person got lucky: “He must have beenat the right place at the right time.”Let me share someone’s life historywith you. This was a man who failed inbusiness at the age of 21; was defeated in alegislative race at age 22; failed again inbusiness at age 24; overcame the death of his sweetheart at age 26; had a nervous breakdownat age 27; lost a congressional race at age 34; lost a senatorial race at age 45; failed in aneffort to become vice-president at age 47; lost a senatorial race at age 49; and was electedpresident of the United States at age 52.This man was Abraham Lincoln.Would you call him a failure? He could have quit. But to Lincoln, defeat was a detourand not a dead end.In 1913, Lee De Forest, the inventor of the triodes tube, was charged by the districtattorney for using fraudulent means to mislead the public into buying stocks of his companyby claiming that he could transmit the human voice across the Atlantic. He was publiclyhumiliated. Can you imagine where we would be without his invention?14Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class XA New York Timeseditorial on December 10,1903, questioned the wisdom ofthe Wright Brothers who weretrying to invent a machine,heavier than air, that would fly.One week later, at Kitty Hawk,the Wright Brothers took theirfamous flight.Colonel Sanders, at age65, with a beat-up car and a $100cheque from social security,realized he had to do something.He remembered his mother's recipe and went out selling. How many doors did he have toknock on before he got his first order? It is estimated that he had knocked on more than athousand doors before he got his first order. How many of us quit after three tries, ten tries,a hundred tries, and then we say we tried as hard as we could?As a young cartoonist, Walt Disney faced many rejections from newspaper editors,who said he had no talent. One day a minister at a church hired him to draw some cartoons.Disney was working out of a small mouse infested shed near the church. After seeing asmall mouse, he was inspired. That was the start of Mickey Mouse.Successful people don't do great things; they only do small things in a great way.One day a partially deaf four year old kid came home with a note in his pocket fromhis teacher, ""Your Tommy is too stupidto learn, get him out of the school."" Hismother read the note and answered,""My Tommy is not stupid to learn, I willteach him myself."" And that Tommygrew up to be the great Thomas Edison.Thomas Edison had only three monthsof formal schooling and he waspartially deaf.Henry Ford forgot to put thereverse gear in the first car he made.15Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class X15Do you consider these people failures? They succeeded in spite of problems, not inthe absence of them. But to the outside world, it appears as though they just got lucky.All success stories are stories of great failures. The only difference is that everytime they failed, they bounced back. This is called failing forward, rather than backward.You learn and move forward. Learn from your failure and keep moving.In 1914, Thomas Edison, at age 67, lost his factory, which was worth a few milliondollars, on fire. It had very little insurance. No longer  a young man, Edison watched hislifetime effort go up in smoke and said, ""There is great value in disaster. All our mistakesare burnt up. Thank God we can start anew."" In spite of the disaster, three weeks later, heinvented the phonograph. What an attitude!Below are more examples of the failures of successful people:1.Thomas Edison failed approximately 10,000 times while he was working on the lightbulb.2.Henry Ford was broke at the age of 40.3.Lee Iacocca was fired by Henry Ford II at the age of 54.4.Young Beethoven was told that he had no talent for music, but he gave some of thebest music to the world.Setbacks are inevitable in life. A setback can act as a driving force and also teach ushumility. In grief you will find courage and faith to overcome the setback. We need to learnto become victors, not victims. Fear and doubt short-circuit the mind.Ask yourself after every setback: What did I learn from this experience? Only thenyou will be able to turn a stumbling block into a stepping stone.The motivation to succeed comes from theburning desire to achieve a purpose. Napoleon Hillwrote, ""Whatever the mind of man can conceiveand believe the mind can achieve.""A young man asked Socrates the secret tosuccess. Socrates told the young man to meet himnear the river the next morning. They met. Socratesasked the young man to walk with him towards theriver. When the water got up to their neck, Socratestook the young man by surprise and ducked himinto the water. The boy struggled to get out butSocrates was strong and kept him there until the16Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class Xboy started turning blue. Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing theyoung man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, “What did you wantthe most when you were there?” The boy replied, ""Air."" Socrates said, “That is the secret tosuccess. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There isno other secret”.A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishments. Just like a small firecannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results.                                                      IF YOU THINKIf you think you are beaten, you are.If you think you dare not, you don't!If you like to win, but think you can't,It's almost a cinch you won't.If you think you'll lose, you're lost;For out in the world we findSuccess begins with a fellow's will;It's all in the state of mind.By  Shiv KheraIf you think you are outclassed, you are,You've got to think high to rise,You've got to be sure of yourself beforeYou can ever win a prize.Life's battles don't always goTo the stronger and faster man,But sooner or later the man who winsIs the man who thinks he can.Shiv Khera is an Indian author of self-help books andactivist. While working in the United States, he was inspired bya lecture delivered by Norman Vincent Peale and followed hismotivational teachings. Khera has written several books includingYou Can Win. His mission is ""to ensure freedom through education andjustice."" Shiv Khera was born in a business family which used to have coal mines atKendua in Dhanbad, India. Soon after the nationalisation of coal mines by the Indiangovernment, he had to search for his own living. In his early years he worked as a carwasher, a life insurance agent, and a franchise operator before he became amotivational speaker.17Free distribution by T.S.

He told his employer-contractor of hisplans to leave the house-building business to live a more leisurely life with his wife andenjoy his extended family. He would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire.They could get by.The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build justone more house as a personal favour. The carpenter agreed. But over time it was easy to seethat his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferiormaterials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career.When the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect the house. Thenhe handed the front-door key to the carpenter and said, “This is your house… my gift toyou.”The carpenter was shocked!What a shame! If he had only known that he was building his own house, he wouldhave done it all so differently.So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our bestinto the building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built. Ifwe could do it over, we would do it much differently.But, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail,place a board, or erect a wall.

He could havegone unnoticed in a crowd,but once you asked him aquestion related to Physicsor Maths, there was a sparkin his eyes. He could grasptheories of science fasterthan the speed of light.He came from a poor but educated family.  His father was a high-school teacher andan avid reader of English literature.  He, like all the boys in his class, was trying to getadmission into some engineering college. The brighter ones wanted to study in the Indian23Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class X23Institutes of Technology, or the IITs.  There was an entrance test for IIT.  This boy, along withhis friends, applied to appear for the test.  They did not have any special books or coaching.All these IIT aspirants would sit below the shade of a stone mandap close to ChamundiHills in the sleepy town of Mysore.  He was the guide for the others.  While the othersstruggled to solve the problems in the question paper, he would smile shyly and solve themin no time.  He sat alone below a tree and dreamt of studying at IIT.  It was the ultimate aimfor any bright boy at that age, as it still is today.  He was then only sixteen years old.The D-Day came.  He came to Bangalore, stayed with some relatives and appearedfor the entrance test.  He did very well but would only say 'OK' when asked.  It was theopposite when it came to food.  When he said 'OK' it implied 'bad', when he said 'good' itimplied 'OK', when he said 'excellent' it implied 'good'.  His principle was never to hurtanyone.  The IIT entrance results came. He had passed with a high rank. What a delight forany student! He was thrilled. He went to his father who was reading a newspaper.‘Anna, I have passed the exam.’‘Well done, my boy.’‘I want to join IIT.’  His father stopped reading the paper. He lifted his head, looked at the boy and saidwith a heavy voice, 'Myson, you are a bright boy.You know our financialposition. I have fivedaughters to be marriedoff and three sons toeducate. I am a salariedperson. I cannot affordyour expenses at IIT. Youcan stay in Mysore andstudy as much as youwant.' Indeed it was a difficult situation for any father to say 'no' to his bright son. Butcircumstances were like that. It was common then for the man to be the single earningmember with a large family dependent on him.24Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22English Class X His father was sad that he had to tell the bitter truth to his son. But it could not behelped. The boy had to understand reality. The teenager was disappointed. It seemed his dreams had burnt to ashes. He was sonear to fulfilling his fondest hope, yet so far. His heart sank in sorrow. He did not reply.  He never shared his unhappiness or helplessness with anybody.He was an introvert by nature.  His heart was bleeding but he did not get angry with anybody.The day came.  His classmates were leaving for Madras (now Chennai).  They weretaking a train from Mysore to Madras.  They have shared good years in school and collegetogether.  He went to the station to say goodbye and good luck to them for their future life.At the station, his friends were already there.  They were excited and talking loudly.The noise was like the chirping of birds.  They were all excited and discussing their newhostels, new courses etc.  He was not part of it.  So, he stood there silently.  One of themnoticed and said, 'You should have made it.'He did not reply.  He only wished all of them.  They waved at him as the train slowlyleft the platform.He stood there even after he could no longer see the train or the waving hands.  It wasthe June of 1962 in Mysore city.  Monsoon had set in and it was getting dark.  It had startedto drizzle.  Yet he stood there motionless.He said to himself, without anger or jealousy, 'All students from the IITs study welland do big things in life.  But it is not the institution; ultimately it is you and you alone whocan change your life by hard work.'Probably he was not aware that he was following the philosophy of the BhagavathGita: 'Your best friend is yourself and your worst enemy is yourself.'Later he worked very hard, and focused on one thing, never bothering about his personallife or comforts.  He shared his wealth with others. He never used the help of any caste,community or political connections to go up in life.A son of a school teacher showed other Indians it was possible to earn wealth legallyand ethically.

This is a special useof the simple past form with verbs like want, wonder, hope, think to make an utterancemore polite or tactful.Examples:a) I wanted to discuss my proposal with you, madam.b) I wondered if I could discuss my proposal with you, sir.c) I thought of discussing my proposal with you, sir.d) I hoped to discuss my proposal with you, sir.Other Uses of the Simple Past Form1) After the conditional if to indicate tentativeness (hypothetical) e.g. If I were the Prime Minister, I would provide free education at all levels.2) After it's time, wishe.g. It's 10 o'clock---it's time you went to bed.3) In reported speech when the reporting verb is in the past tense.e.g. I asked you what the time was.The present perfectThe present perfect (has/have + Verb in the past participle form)  refers to actions inthe past which have no definite time reference. The present perfect in English is used in thefollowing three situations:1. The present perfect tense is often used to talk about past actions and events which arecompletely finished. However, instead of the simple past, the present perfect is used ifthe action has current relevance, that is, it is related to the speaker's experience. In thiscase even though the actions took place in the past, they are still with the speaker, as partof his/her experience and knowledge. This use of the present perfect is therefore alsocalled the experiential use of the present perfect.e.g. I have seen the Taj Mahal.       (Meaning: I know the Taj Mahal. It is still fresh in my memory.)       (Contrast: I saw the Taj Mahal two years ago.)60English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-222. To indicate an action/situation which began in the past and which has continued up to thepresent moment, i.e. the moment when we are speaking, the present perfect tense isused.        e.g. I have lived in Hyderabad for 10 years.(Meaning: I started living in Hyderabad 10 years ago and I am still  living in Hyderabad.)If you wish to state that you still continue to live in Hyderabad you should say, ' I have beenliving in Hyderabad for 10 years'.This use of the present perfect is also known as its linking use as it links the past withthe present.3. The present perfect is also used to refer to past actions/events whose results are seen inthe present, i.e. when there is evidence in the present for some action/event that happenedin the past. Hence, it is also called the evidential use of the present perfect. This iscalled resultative past.e.g. It has rained! (evidence-Look! The ground is wet.)The following examples make the difference clear:1.   I saw the film, Gandhi last March. (Here the speaker is calling attention to theaction of seeing and to the time when it happened.)2.   I have seen the film, Gandhi.  (Here the speaker is not saying when he saw the film.He is calling attention to the fact that he is now a person with personal experienceof the film or someone who can tell us about it.)3. I cut my finger when I was sharpening the pencil.  (Nothing is said   about any resultnow.)4. I have cut my finger (and it is bleeding now.)The simple past is often used with adverbs of past time (e.g. yesterday, two monthsago, in June, in 1965, during the war).Sometimes it is also used to refer to present time or future time actions.e.g.,1. Sir, may I come in? I wanted to talk to you.2. If you left for Delhi tomorrow,when would you return?61English Class X61Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22The present perfect is never used with adverbs of past time. You should not say, forexample, 'She has gone to Hyderabad yesterday'. Say either 'She went to Hyderabad yesterday',if you are interested in the action and in the time when it happened, or 'She has gone toHyderabad', if you wish to convey the idea that she is not in the town now.The present perfect can be used with adverbs of present time (e.g. today, this morning,this week, this month).Ex. I have seen  Raju this week.The present perfect is also used with just, recently, yet, already, never, ever, often, sofar, etc.Ex. They have just gone.Ex.  Hasn’t Anirudh left yet ?Read the following sentences .Complete the conversations with theappropriate forms of the verbs. Then say why you chose simple past/presentperfect forms.1.

25,,The Brave Potter,"Marguerite Siek has chosen a very well-known Indian folktale for retelling inEnglish. Children and adults alike are fond of folktales, which are often amusing andsometimes instructive.It was dark. Thick black clouds covered the evening sky. The thunder roared and thestrong wind shook the branches and leaves of the trees in the forest. Pit. . . pat . . .  pit, dropsof rain fell. Then the lightning flashed and split the black sky with its blinding light. Soon itwas raining heavily.An old tiger ran through the rain looking for shelter. He was wet and cold and hiscave was far away. While hurrying to his shelter he saw an old hut. With a sigh of relief thetiger crawled under the thatched roof and lay down by the door. Except for the sound of therain all was quiet. Before he could nod off, however, he heard something heavy being draggedinside the hut. This was followed by the voice of a woman.'Oh, how terrible this leak is!' she complained. 'How terrible! I would rather meet atiger in the forest than have this leak in my house!''A leak?' the tiger thought. 'What is a leak? It must be very dangerous and strong orthe woman would not be more frightened of the leak than of me. Am I not rightly called theking of the forest? Aren't they all afraid of me? I wonder what a leak looks like . . . ?Soon afterwards the tired tiger fell asleep. He was suddenly awakened by an angryvoice shouting in his ear. He felt heavy blows fall upon his head and shoulders.'You horrible beast!' a voice screamed angrily. 'How dare you run away? How dareyou make me walk about in the middle of the night trying to find you! Be careful, one ofthese days I'll kill you! Now, go home!'The old tiger shivered. 'This must be the leak who has come out of the hut. I'd betterdo as he says or he will kill me.'So the tiger allowed himself to be bound around the neck with a thick rope. Themysterious creature then climbed onto the tiger's back and pulled at the rope.  'Come on,67English Class X67Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22head for home!' shouted the voice. The tiger felt a sharp kick on his side. The tiger wasterrified and he ran through the dark forest. The creature pulled hard on the rope to tell himwhich way to go. At the same time it scolded, cursed and kicked the poor tiger. Soon theystopped in front of a small hut on the edge of the thick forest. The creature climbed downfrom the tiger's back and bound him with an iron chain to a nearby tree. Then he went insidethe hut. The tiger could not free himself from the chain; so he had to spend a miserablenight under the tree. Who was this creature who was able to capture such a large and dangeroustiger? Let's find out.On the afternoon of that day, a potter had arrived home after a hard day's work. Hewas tired and thirsty. He had asked his wife for some palm-wine. The more he drank, thebetter he felt. When he had drunk all the wine he no longer felt tired. When the storm beganthe potter suddenly remembered that he had left his donkey tied under a tree. He rushed outof his hut to take the animal into the stable. You can imagine his anger when he discoveredthat the donkey was not there anymore -- the only thing left was its chain!'My stupid donkey must have run off into the forest,' he grumbled. 'When I catch himI'll give him a good beating!'68English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22The potter walked through the wet forest. When it became dark he often stumbledover roots and fallen branches. With each step the potter felt angrier and angrier with hisdonkey.'When I catch him, I'll tie him up under the tree all night,' he muttered to himself.Hours later, the potter reached the old woman's hut. There he saw an animal sleepingin front of the door.'There he is!' he shouted. 'There he is, the stupid animal!'The drunken potter did not notice the difference between the donkey and a tiger. Hekicked and beat the sleeping tiger. He then jumped onto the frightened animal's back, rode ithome, and then tied it up with the iron chain.Next morning the villagers who passed the potter's house looked in amazement atthe tiger tied to the tree. Soon the news spread throughout the village that the potter hadcaught a tiger and tied it to a tree in his yard. All the villagers praised his courage. They alsothanked him because the tiger had eaten many of their goats and buffaloes. They had tried tocatch him for many years but had failed. Of course, the potter said that he had done nothingof the sort. He said that he had only brought his donkey home. He did not understand how adonkey could change into a tiger! When he saw the tiger, he fainted.Nobody, however, believed the potter's story. The villagers even praised him for beingmodest. Soon the potter became famous. Everybody who met him called him the bravepotter. The simple potter himself never understood why.*    *    *    *    *A few years later war broke out between the potter's country and a much strongerneighbour. The king immediately gathered a large army. But he realized that it was not strongenough to save his country from defeat. He needed a hero to lead his army. Where could hefind such a brave man? The king hurriedly called his ministers together and asked theiradvice.One of the ministers remembered the story of the brave potter.'Your Majesty,' the minister said, 'I know someone who can lead our army.'The king immediately sent a messenger to the potter's house. When the potter realizedthat he had been made General of the Army, he became frightened. The king had ordered him69English Class X69Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22to go to the palace the next day. How could he, a poor ignorant potter, become the Generalof the Army? He had never carried a sword, nor had he ever ridden a horse.'Oh, I shall die because of that stupid donkey,' groaned the potter to his wife. 'He hasonly brought us trouble.'The next day he went with his wife to the capital. The king was pleased to see him andordered the potter to lead the army into battle the next day. The enemy were not far from thegates of the city. A splendid house had been prepared for the potter and his wife. The horsewhich would carry him into battle was ready in the stable.That night the potter could not sleep. He was nervous and worried because he did notknow how to ride a horse.'If I fall off, everybody will laugh at me,' he thought. 'I will get up very early tomorrowand practise riding the horse.'At dawn the potter woke up his wife and they went to the stable. They saw the beautifulbrown horse ready for its new master.'Oh, how tall he is!' sighed the potter. 'I shall never be able to climb onto his back.'70English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22‘Put this bench beside him’, said his wife, ‘and use it as a step.’Even with the help of the bench the potter had much difficulty climbing onto thehorse's back. When he was finally seated, he found that the saddle was very slippery. 'Pleasetie my feet to the stirrups, dear wife,' said the potter, 'otherwise I shall certainly fall off.'His wife found some rope and bound her husband's feet tightly to the stirrups. Shethen passed the rope underneath the horse and tied the two stirrups together. She also passeda length of rope around the potter's waist and tied him to the saddle.'Now please tie my hands to his neck,' said the potter. Meanwhile the big brownhorse was impatiently pawing his hooves on the ground. When the potter's wife tried to passanother rope around its neck, the horse suddenly jumped free. It galloped out of the stablewith the potter hanging like a sack of rice on its back. Only the ropes kept him from crashingto the ground. The potter held tightly to the horse's neck and prayed to all the gods to savehis life. After galloping through the quiet streets, the horse crashed through the city gatesand raced across the open fields. It leapt over fences and streams, and began to head for theenemy's camp. When the potter realized where they were going, he tried harder than ever tostop the horse. He pulled wildly on the reins but it was no use; the horse galloped on.When they passed a young tree, the potter grabbed a branch. But the horse did notstop. Instead the tree was pulled out of the ground. A sentry from the enemy camp saw thepotter galloping towards the camp with a tree in one hand and his reins in the other. 'Thatmust be the General who captured a tiger with his bare hands,' he thought. 'Now he hasuprooted a tree with only one hand! He is not an ordinary man-he's a giant!' 'Run, run, saveyourselves! The famous Tiger-General is coming at the head of a large army to attack us. Hehas the strength of a giant! He has uprooted a tree with one hand!'The frightened soldiers fled. Their king was left by himself in his tent. Hurriedly hewrote a letter begging for peace and apologizing for attacking the country. He left this letterin the tent. Then he jumped on his horse and followed his soldiers. When the potter's brownhorse reached the deserted camp it stopped. With shaking hands the potter untied his feetand fell to the ground. When he looked around he was surprised to find the camp empty. Helooked in the king's tent and found the letter. The puzzled potter walked back to the city withthe letter in his pocket. He went to his wife and gave her the letter.'Dear wife,' he said, 'never in my life will I ride a horse again. Please take this letterto our king and tell him that the enemy has run away. I am going to bed.' His wife ran towardsthe palace with the letter. When the king read the letter, he was full of praise for his new71English Class X71Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22General. He asked the potter's wife where her husband was. 'My husband is tired, Your Majesty.The servants have put him to bed,' answered the wife respectfully.'Let him rest today. Tell him to come tomorrow to receive his reward,' the king said.Next morning the potter went to the king's palace. He left the brown horse in thestable and walked to the palace with his wife. The streets were filled with cheering crowds.They had all heard about his brave action.'Look how humble he is,' they said to each other.'Any other man would ride to the palace on a horse but he is walking like an ordinaryman. He's truly a humble and brave man.'The king rewarded the potter so well that he did not need to work again.

27,,Reading,
28,,The Journey,"After spending a leisurely Sunday at home, the very thought of returning to work on Mondayis tiring. Lethargy creeps in if the holiday continues over an extended period. That is how I feltwhen I was preparing to return to my place of work after spending six months at home. The factthat I was to leave behind my newly-wed wife and go to a far-off place did not help either. ObviouslyI did not want to go.However, I finally did decide to go. I did not have much to carry by way of luggage – justa trunk. Ours is a hilly terrain, without any motorable roads – and there is no certainty that we areever going to have any roads. In any case, while coming home we do not carry bedding. Besides,I had come home this time round for a special purpose: to get married. My parents had arrangedmy marriage, according to the customs of our tribal society. Time flew, and five months into mymarriage I realized it. Initially I thought of extending my leave – even taking unpaid leave. Butafter some dilly-dallying, I finally decided against it because marriage had increased myresponsibilities and I had got into debt.On my way home from the bus stop, my trunk had been carried by a porter. The problemnow was we couldn’t find anyone who could help me carry the trunk to the bus stop. At anothertime of the year, we would have easily found someone to help me, but now most of the villagerswere busy in the fields. Nobody had time to spare for me. In fact, carrying the trunk should nothave been such a worry for me except that my education had made me shun physical labour. Afterall, I was a government officer and the idea of people seeing me carry my own luggage was not atall amusing. Otherwise, for a young man like me it should not have been an issue to carry a 20-kilo chest on my back.Finally, my father came up with a solution. ‘Don’t worry. I myself will see you off atDirang.’I protested. How could I allow my old father to carry my trunk? What would people think?What would they say? But I failed to dissuade him. It was decided that father would carry thechest.A large crowd gathered at our place the day I was to leave. People had come to wish meluck. It was 10.20 when I left for Dirang. My father had already left. As I had to do a bit ofcatching up, I walked fast. Three kilometres down the road, I caught up with my father. Fathersaid, ‘You are late. Would you like to rest for some time?’78English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Having walked fast I was tired. Moreover, I had to cross two hills on the way up to thespot. I quickly sat down on a rock. My father laughed at my plight.‘So this little distance has tired you? Rest for a while. But we have to be in time forthe bus.’Father was quiet for some time. He thoughtfully looked at the sun for a moment, andthen his eyes fell on the can of home-made wine that I was carrying. Wetting his lips withhis tongue he said in a matter-of-fact manner, ‘I am thirsty’.I gave him the can of wine. He poured himself a mug and handed me the can. Hedrank all of it at one go. He then arranged the belt that was attached to the trunk carefully onhis forehead. So, this was the picture: my father carrying my luggage on his back and mefollowing him with a tiny bag in my hand. We were walking up a narrow hilly road, andneither of us uttered a word as if we were strangers who spoke different languages. I did notknow what was going on in his mind. From time to time it crossed my mind that it wasimproper for me to let father carry the luggage. I wanted to tell him that I would like to carrythe trunk myself, but my guilt and shame did not allow me to do so. This self-consciousnesshad probably to do with my education, the white-collar job that I had, or quite simply my78English Class X79Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22pride. Somehow, I had the feeling that if I carried the luggage, my father and my people, infact the whole world would laugh at me and I would be belittled.Father had provided for my education, and I had been able to realize his dreams. Myparents were truly proud of me. It was through me that they had earned a greater degree ofadmiration and respect from the villagers. My father would not like to see me carrying atrunk on my back and would be very hurt if I did so. I concluded that it would be better to lethim carry it. Father was used to carrying luggage anyway. He was stronger and more skilledthan me in these matters. I had never got used to physical labour having stayed in hostelsright from my childhood. So, in spite of my youth and strength, I was physically useless. Icontinued walking silently with father. We rested at two places on the way and had our tiffinbut we hardly talked. Finally, we reached Dirang. The bus from Tawang had not yet reachedDirang and so we had some time in hand. We entered a tea shop and sat facing each other.Father appeared tired. I felt sorry for him but couldn’t bring myself to say anything. I askedthe waiter to get us two cups of tea. Just as I was going to take my first sip, I heard father’svoice, ‘Do you have a pair of old shoes?’‘Why?’ I asked.‘The road is uneven and full of pebbles. It hurts while walking.’80English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22I looked at father’s bare feet. Never having worn shoes, his feet had developed cracksand somehow resembled those of an elephant. I noticed this for the first time. I hadn’tnoticed that the road was uneven. I didn’t have to since I was wearing a pair of hunting boots.I checked my wallet and saw I still had around Rs.40 with me. A pair of canvas shoes wouldcost around Rs.12 and the remaining amount would be enough for me to get to Bomdila.My father protested. ‘Give me an old pair. You don’t have to spend money on newshoes.’  I couldn’t convince him to buy a new pair. Reluctantly I gave him the hunting bootsI was wearing.

32,,A Reading,
33,,Rendezvous with Ray,"It was a unique friendship that developed between aFrench-Canadian priest and one of the world’s greatest filmdirectors, and had a singular impact on Bengali films bothacademically and practically. It was enroute to India in1961,at a stopover in New York, that 26-year- old Fr. GastonRoberge was acquainted with the works of Satyajit Raythrough the Apu Trilogy. He found the world of Apu sofascinating that he saw all three films in one sitting; and therebegan his longstanding love affair with the people of Indiaand Bengali cinema and culture, which led to path-breakingwork in those fields. In his latest book, Satyajit Ray,Essays:1970-2005, a compilation of his essays as the namesuggests, being published by Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, Roberge provides a scholarly,original analysis of Ray’s works, giving an insight into the greatness of Ray both as a personand as an artist.“The Apu Trilogy was, in fact, my first portal to West Bengal and its people,” he toldFrontline. In his youth , all he knew of Bengal was through Mircea Eliade’s La Nuit Bengalie,some of Tagore’s poems, and a Reader’s Digest article on Mother Teresa. If the harsh imageof poverty brought out by the article on the “Saint of the Slums” haunted him, Apu’s worldcame as a reassurance. “No. Apu, Sarbajaya, even Harihar did not need my help-but how not tolove them? I thought it was fortunate that I wouldsoon be among them,” he wrote.Roberge does not endorse the accusation ofRay’s detractors that the master director made hisreputation selling India’s poverty to the West. “Whatstruck me most was not the material poverty depictedin the films, but the enormous spiritual poverty ofsome rich people is much more deplorable thanmaterial poverty,” he said. Roberge does not speakwith the arrogance of the West. “ I was here on aquest to know the world and in the process know Gaston Roberge102English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22myself. I did not come here to convert. In fact, I am the one who got converted,” he said.But it took him nine years after reaching Calcutta (now Kolkata) and joining St.Xavier’s College, to muster up the confidence to meet Ray in person. “Although I wanted tomeet him right away, I didn’t want to just go and see him like he was a living museum piece.I wanted to prepare myself, get to know his works more, so that when we met, there could bea worthwhile dialogue,” he said. When they finally met, it was the beginning of a closefriendship that lasted 22 years- until Ray’s death in 1992.“It was a very quiet friendship that developed over the years. Manikda [as Ray wasaffectionately called by his friends] was a shy person and always very discreet about displayinghis emotions,” said Roberge. Though to outsiders, Ray’s massive stature- physical andintellectual- might have made him come across as cold, aloof and even intimidating, he wasin reality a very simple and unassuming man with a subtle sense of humour. It was an unspokenarrangement between the two  of them to meet on Sundays at 9 a.m. at Ray’s residence onBishop Lefroy Road, Kolkata. Ray would invite Roberge over for private screenings of hislatest films and welcomed comments on them. But this happened only after the friendshiphad cemented, for in the early days of their dialogue Ray’s shyness prevented him fromtalking about his own films.102English Class X103Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22“He was even shy of receiving compliments,” said Roberge. To Roberge, the greatestmark of Ray’s appreciation for him was that he often addressed the French-speaking priestin Bengali, “in spite of my lack of elegance in that language, and the fact that Ray knew bothEnglish and Bengali so well.”“Ray’s screenplay manuscripts were an art by themselves,” Roberge says, “hand-written in Bengali, with notes in English for his set-designer, with sketches here and there,and occasional staff notation of fragments of music”. One Sunday morning, Roberge foundRay in a disturbed mood. A few well –known personalities of the city had visited him earlierto go through some of his manuscripts. After they left Ray found the Charulatha screenplaymissing. Ray was almost sure who the culprit was. “I asked him whether he was planning totake any action, and he said no, and explained to me that he did not want to hurt the reputationof the person. I was absolutely stunned by his humane concern,” said Roberge.Like Rabindranath Tagore, Ray strode his time like a colossus. Roberge writes,  “Itis as if all Bengal was in Manikda: the rich and the poor, the powerful and the humble, thepeasants and the city persons, children, teenagers, adults and old people, men and women.”Philosophically too, Roberge feels, Ray took off where Tagore signed out. If onecompares the last major prose piece by Tagore, “ Shabhyatar Sankat” ( Crisis of Civilisation),which he wrote at the beginning of the Second World War, which contains his immortal104English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22dictum that in spite of what washappening it would be a sin to losefaith in Man, and the last three filmsof Ray- Ganashatru, ShakhaPrashakha, and Agantuk- theanalogy becomes clear.“In these three films Ray wasat his most personal and when somecritics saw the films as didactic andverbose, he felt deeply hurt. For, inthese last films, Satyajit wasdirectly talking to us, conveying hispersonal message on society and civilization. If the impulse that motivated his earlier filmswas aesthetics, in the last three it was self-expression. And there we were denying him hisright to speak.  As the saying goes, no one is a prophet in one’s own country,” said Roberge.An agnostic throughout his life, it is possible, Roberge feels, that in the face of death Raywas searching for an answer. This was suggested by some of the music that he used in ShakhaPrashakha.The last time the two friends met, Ray was in hospital, on his deathbed. It was aSunday and Roberge, true to habit, arrived on the dot at 9 a.m. “He had grown so weak that helooked frail as a child. I did not stay long, and as I was leaving, Manikda said, ‘Bhalo laglo’[it was nice]. Those were his last words to me,” said Roberge.One important fallout of this friendship was the establishment of Chitrabani, acommunication and film institute, the first of its kind in West Bengal, which Roberge foundedin 1970 and to which Ray, as a token of friendship, lent his name as co-founder. Ray was inthe first governing body and after a few terms readily agreed to be the institute’s adviser.Roberge arranged most of the initial funding from Canadian agencies. “I had no reservationsapplying for them, for I feel richer countries in the West are indebted to countries likeIndia,” he said.For 26 years Roberge was the director of Chitrabani and under him the institute notonly produced important documentary features, but also became breeding ground for localtalent for film-making…Frontline, July29-August11, 2006 an image fromPater Panchali104English Class X105Free distribution by T.S.

34,,Maya Bazaar,"K. V. Reddy's  'Maya Bazaar'  has been voted as the 'Greatest Indian Film' in anonline poll conducted by a television news channel. The poll was conducted to find outIndia's greatest film till date, on the occasion of 100 Years of  Indian Cinema and peoplechose 'Maya Bazaar' over other Indian classics. The film is considered one of the enduringclassics of Indian cinema and was christened as a landmark achievement in Indian film'scinematography, art direction and VFX with the available technology during that time. Thefollowing is a review on the film when it celebrated the Golden Jubilee in 2007.‘Maya Bazaar' forever!Fifty years ago, director K.V. Reddy or for that matter, producers Nagireddy andChakrapani, would not haveimagined what they were unleashingwhen they decided to make MayaBazaar- a bilingual in Telugu andTamil.The finished product hit thescreen in 1957 to become alandmark movie in the Telugu filmindustry. It became a hit not onlyfor the sterling performances ofthe star-ensemble that it had rightfrom S.V. Ranga Rao, Savitri, NTR,ANR, and Gummadi, but alsobecause K.V. Reddy was in fullcontrol over every frame of it.There is little else onecould expect when all time greats like Marcus Bartley (cinematography), Ghantasala (music),M.L.Vasantha Kumari, Leela, Suseela and Madhavapeddi (playback), Gokhale (art),Pasumarthy(choreography) and Pitambaram(make-up) got together  to weave magic aroundan episode from Mahabharatha, Sasirekha Parinayam.However, the greatness of Maya Bazaar, about which much is said and written, isnot just because of these facets alone.116English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22It is a tribute to Telugu culture,language and customs of the land. Thefilm was watched repeatedly soon afterits  release because people identifiedevery  character  of the film withsomeone they knew in their immediatevicinity and the audience still do thesame now.The dialogues written by PingaliNagendra Rao (as well the lyrics) werethe same that the people were hearingor using in their conversations everyday -  if not, those became a part of Telugu life thereafter. Sasirekha’s, nay Ghatothkacha'sManadi Sodara Prema… became immortalized as much as Suryakantam's anthaalamalame kada which has become a way of life in greeting people.As for songs, Aha naa pelli anta still reverberates in marriages and Vivaahabhojanambu is yet another must.An entire repertoire was added to the Telugu dictionary by the film. Take for exampleTalpam used for denoting a cot or a bed. Were Telugus using Gilpam as an antonym of it tillthe movie's advent? Nor did anyone tell so emphatically until Ghatothkacha that Evaruputtinchakunte maatalela pudathayi and hence if friends are to be called Asamadiyuluthen enemies could be termedTasamadiyulu. Will anyone forget theexpression veyandira veedikoveeratadu? No exception to hai haisodara and hai hai naayaka .The story itself is wovenaround the love of Sasirekha-Abhimanyu.  With Krishna andBalarama having difference of opinionover it, their wives too take sides asis inevitable in any family. Tointroduce the theme , the director usesa magic box, (an equivalent of a TV116English Class X117Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22screen) which displays whatever is dearto the viewer's heart.Sasirekha naturally seesAbhimanyu and Balarama gets to see hissishya, Duryodhana on it. His wife lapsup the sight of an array of jewellery andthe audience laughed heartily becausethey knew that someone back home wasequally attached to the riches.When Balarama curtly tells hissister, "" Subhadra! Aagadalu,aghaayityalu naaku paniki raavu"",when he was confronted with the latter'sindignation at his decision to separateSasirekha and Abhimanyu , womenfolk among the viewers sighed recalling their owntribulations in the hands of such brothers.Frame after frame impacts viewers with similarities. The greatness of the directorlies here- he successfully reduces all characters to ordinary mortals displaying all the folliesof human beings except Ghatothkacha and Krishna. And then he injects into the Yadavahousehold a Telugu atmosphere, full with its simile, imagery, adage, sarcasm and wit.The result — a feast for the eyes and soul. That is Maya Bazaar for you. Mind you,this is a story of Paandavas and Kauravas with the Yadavas pitching in. But one neversees the Paandavas throughout the film. Weonly hear of them.If any NRI asks you to suggest ways toteach Telugu culture just ask him or her tointroduce them to Maya Bazaar first. Further,if they seek to know about their uncles, auntsand cousins back home, bring in their names ,“look, this is your Balarama…”Any better way of doing it?Then onwards it's all Laahiri, laahiri,laahiri lo…-The Hindu, 21 April 2006118English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

35,,A Tribute,"The Indian film industry hascompleted a hundred years in the year 2013.It is a fitting tribute to the world of cinemato recollect our favourite films, producers,directors, actors, and music and art directors.Telugu audiences are proud of manygreat producers, directors and artistes.Savitri is one such prestigious artiste.  Eversince she was eight, she evinced interest inlearning dance. Later she associated herselfwith the theatre. She formed a theatreorganization as well. She had little difficultyin entering the film field. When Savitri wastwelve, she was offered a role in the film,Agnipareeksha, but was finally dropped asshe looked too young for the role.She was given a song sequence-Ranante rane ranu- in 'Pathala Bhairavi'.Savitri's part in it was brief, but the effect of her performance was considerable. Herexpressions were beautiful. A lot of film makers recognized 'a potential artiste' in her.As a result, she was elevated to the role of a heroine by the noted director L VPrasad in the film 'Samsaaram'(1950).   On the sets, she was nervous; she had to repeatmany takes and this proved a setback for her. The role was given to someone else and shewas given a small role of less import.In the film 'Devadasu' (1953), [one of] the best picturisation[s] of SaratchandraChatterjee's novel 'Devadas', Parvathi comes alive in Savitri. The young Parvathi with curlyhair, a lock of hair straying to her forehead, the large round black berry eyes looking outfrom an innocent face left an indelible imprint in the minds of all cine lovers. She portrayedDevada's love and the role of a rich man's wife marvellously. Savitri left her mark in thisevergreen Telugu classic.126English Class X127Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Savitri established her credentialswith 'Ardhangi'(1955) . She gave anexceptionally brilliant performance as awoman forced to marry a mentallyretarded person (ANR). She nurses himback to health. She also teaches a lessonto her in-laws who conspire against herhusband.Savitri captured the audiences withher charm and magnificent acting. She wasable to convey a wide range of feelingsthrough her expressive eyes. Hermischievous look - it captivates anyone; the look of fake anger provokes, the look filledwith real anger pierces the heart. The look of passion while waiting for her lover; the painfilled look when her love fails; the confident look that seems ready to face any situation, allthese myriad emotions are hidden in her eyes .The dimensions are endless and pages can befilled to describe the magic spell of her eyes.Savitri's amazing talent was in full form in 'Missamma', a hit comedy that establishedSavitri's place firmly as a star. Mary in the film comes into an agreement with a Hinduyouth, Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao (NTR) to pretend as a couple in order to get a job in aschool. Mary was a Christian to the core, whereas Rao was a tolerant Hindu. What results inis a three hour pure comedy for the audience!Savitri was adored for the matchless ease in expression. Meena Kumari,the heroineof Hindi films said, “when I watch Savitri's acting, I usually get doubts about my own acting"".Her strikingly expressive eyes and her superb sense of timing made her one of the greatestactresses. Amitabh Bacchan felt, 'Savitri was one of the first actresses with unbelievablespontaneity'.Maya Bazaar is another filmthat brought fame to Savitri. Sheplayed the role of Sasirekha.Recollecting the 16-annas Telugulass clad in parikini, in the song'allibilli ammayiki…' reminds us ofthe rich Telugu culture ofyesteryears. In the final part of thefilm, Savitri plays the role of128English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22maya(not real) Sasirekha(Ghatotkacha in disguise).Shewalks in a masculine manner imitating the legendary SVRanga Rao acting as  Ghatotkacha in the film   toperfection.The theatre rocks with laughter when LakshmanaKumara (Relangi) is teased by maya Sasirekha. Sheswitches from the feminine to the masculine in thetwinkling of an eye and needless to say, a female artistedisplaying masculine demon  qualities with a club inhand has no parallel.Savitri gets totally involved in whatever role sheplays. 'Chivaraku Migiledi' is one such film. She playedthe role of a nurse in a psychiatry ward. In a particularscene the nurse has a nervous breakdown and criesuncontrollably. The shot was over.  ""CUT"", the director said, but Savitri who played the rolecould not stop crying! Everyone in the set had to run to her and pacify her. The film becamea milestone in her career!!Savitri was awarded the title 'Mahanati' (the Supreme artiste).She also received thePresidential award for her performance in 'Chivaraku Migiledi', the magnum opus of Savitri.She was the recipient of 'Kalaimamani' and 'Nadigayar Tilakam' from Tamil film industry.Savitri had nearly 300 films to her credit. Her career was nearly 30 year long. She wasequally admired by Telugu and Tamil film lovers. She also acted in  a few Kannada and Hindifilms. She had a lion's share of films when she was at the zenith of her career. Her passionfor films was so strong that she directed and produced a few films, in spite of certainadversities.Savitri was a humane artiste. She was generous to the people who were in need.Once, she donated all the jewellery she was wearing to the Prime Minister's fund. Her riseas a star was like a meteor. She left the world in 1981 leaving an envied and unsurpassedlegacy behind her.Savitri is no more. But she is among us with her unforgettable roles. Her versatilitylives on and on and on.Paying tribute to her, the director and producer Dasari Narayana Rao said:128English Class X129Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22""...  Many artistes are forgotten soon after the death. But, it is not so with Savitri.SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS LONG AS CELLULOID LIVES ON. 'All her films would amount to an 'Album of life' due to their range of themes; theyencompass human lives and passions in their full diversity. What is cinema? Is it a fiction ora reality?  Many people say many things. But Savitri gave a different definition. She said thatcinema is ' Life'. Life is eternal. So is cinema because life runs through it.

44,,The Storeyed House - I,"There was something really wrong with the State Transport bus. It had come up thewinding road in the mountain as if with a life-time  effort. The road was now down-hill and yetthe bus moved as slowly as a sick man walking with the help of another. It reached the plainwhere the dispensary building was situated, and stood still, like an obstinate bull. Now, thedestination was hardly a mile or two away. But the driver was sore and the conductor had nooption but to be silent. When they realized that the bus wouldn't move any faster, a couple ofpassengers exclaimed: ""Goddammit for a bloody nuisance!""           The conductor asked the passengers to get down and they all put their strengthtogether to push the bus. Having gained this initial momentum, the bus started. Passengersclambered up, jostling one another. The conductor rang the bell and the bus gradually took onspeed. It entered the village reluctantly like a truant child being dragged to school. As itwound its way through the curves on the outskirts, it groaned and croaked like a hen about tolay eggs, and stopped with a bang in front of Bhujaba Patil's residence. As it halted, it gave a136English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22big lurch, sending the passengers helter-skelter, churned like water in a pitcher when thecarrier stumbles.All the passengers got down.The coolie put his hand on a huge wooden box and shouted,  'Whose box is this?'Bayaji, who was brushing away the dust from his body,  answered, 'Oh, it's mine ,please lower it down.'The coolie heaved and grunted as he lowered the box which Bayaji caught with ease.Bayaji had packed his entire household goods in this box. There was no longer anyreason to hang around in Bombay. He had worked honestly for the past thirty-five years inthe dockyard and had retired from service two months before. Not that he had held animportant position. He had merely got an extension for two years; during that period he hadbecome a supervisor. Otherwise his entire life had been spent lifting heavy loads. He hadworked very hard whenever he could, day and night.Bayaji had crossed sixty but was in sound health. He had a sturdy frame right frombirth, and hard work had given a well formed shape to his strong body. He paid fifteen paiseto the coolie, put the box, in which he had thrown pots and pans and sundry other things, onhis own head and began to walk in the direction of his house.As he reached Kadam's house, he saw Bhujaba coming towards him. Bhujaba was aknown rascal of the village. Bayaji balanced the burden on his head. Straightening his neck,he said, 'Greetings to you, sir, how are things with you?'Bayaji was a Mahar by caste and according to age-old custom he should have greetedBhujaba with 'My humble salutations to you, sir, who are my father and mother.' So, whenBayaji merely said 'Greetings.' Bhujaba became furious and said, 'Do you think you canbecome a Brahmin merely by saying ""Greetings""? Can you forget your position simplybecause you've turned a Buddhist?'Bayaji was nonplussed. For a moment, he was tempted to knock him down with hisbox but realised that he couldn't afford to do so. Besides, now he had come back to hisvillage for good. He was to spend the rest of his days on this soil and would be interred inthe same soil. He would not be able to return to Pune or Bombay hereafter. It was not a goodpolicy to incur the hostility of anyone in the village, least so of the Patil, the village headman.137English Class X137Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22So he said in a meek tone, 'Sir, why spring this on me even before I set foot on thesoil of my forefathers? I have to stay here till the end of my life.''Why? Aren't you going back to your job?' asked Bhujaba. 'No sir, my service is over,I've turned sixty.' With this Bayaji lifted the load from his head a little to place it in position.'Then you've collected your fund amount?' Bhujaba was taking his measure. 'Yes, sir',Bayaji replied with pride. 'How much?' Bhujaba asked greedily. 'Not much, what can a dailyworker earn?' Bayaji answered. 'Why won't you mention the figure, man?' Bhujaba persistedartfully. 'Some two and a half thousand rupees.' Bayaji gave the correct figure. 'Bayaji, you have a heavy load on your head. Go to your house first. We'll talk atleisure later.' Bhujaba said in mock sympathy.'Yes, yes' Bayaji mumbled and walked in the direction of his house. At the moment,Bayaji was the proud owner of two and a half thousand rupees in cash, so it made no differencewhether he was an untouchable or a Buddhist. If only one could swindle out of the138English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22untouchable Bayaji- or rather Buddhist, Bayaji- four or five hundred rupees, that was enough.With the thought in his mind, Bhujaba entered his wada, the big house.Exchanging pleasantries with people he met on the way, Bayaji reached the publicbuilding called Takkya in the untouchables' settlement. The building  was named BuddhaVihar by those who had embraced Buddhism. As Bayaji neared Buddha Vihar, the children,who were playing with a ball made of rags, finished their game and cried out, 'Baiju Nana ishere, Baiju Nana is here!' and scampered in the direction of Bayaji's house. Bayaji's eighty-five-year-old mother quickly scrambled to her feet. She had aged much but her old-wornframe was still sturdy, and her teeth were strong enough to break grams. She could thread aneedle without help. When she heard of Bayaji's arrival her heart swelled.As Bayaji came in, his wife concealed her joy with the end of her sari and took downthe box from his head. His grandchildren clung to him and began to twist the folds of hisdhoti. The neighbouring children watched the scene in idle curiosity.'Come, get into the house, children!' said Bayaji. His mother walked out with a bentback and told Bayaji to wait outside the door. Bayaji obeyed.The old woman came forward, poured some water over the piece of bread in herhand, moved it around Bayaji's face and flung it away as an offering. She ran her palms overhis cheeks and pressed her fingers on her temples. All eight fingers gave out a crackingsound.Bayaji's family was doing well .He had eight children in all, six sons and two daughters.The daughters had been married off and had given birth to children. The elder son lookedafter the fields, the next two sons were in government service, the one after them was aschool- teacher and the sixth one was still studying. Since they knew that Bayaji was cominghome for good, the elder son in service and the two daughters were already home to greethim. All of them wondered what their father had got for them from his lifetime earnings.The next day when Bayaji opened the box, it revealed only some pots and pans, nailsand photographs.Looking at these, the elder daughter  asked, 'Nana, how is it that you haven't broughtanything for us?'Bayaji was amused that his daughters thought in this childish manner even after theyhad children of their own. He ran his eyes over all his children and said, 'Look here, children,139English Class X139Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22if I had brought new clothes for you, they'd tear, if I had brought an ornament it would soonwear out. Out of my earnings I wish you to have something that'll last longer. Bayaji paused after these words.His eldest son was godly. He said, 'Neither we nor our wives want anything. Tell uswhat you'd like us to do.''Look children, ours is such a large family. Even at mealtime, we've to eat by turns orsit crowded, knocking our knees together. I wish to build a house out of my earnings, and ithas to be a storeyed house; the usual three-portioned house won't be adequate for us.'All were happy with this plan.The plan was finalised and the foundation of the storeyed house was laid on theauspicious New Year Day.goddammit (phr):an expression used  to show that one is angry or annoyedmomentum (n):impetus gained by movement.clambered (v):climbedjostling (v):pushingreluctantly (adv):unwillinglytruant child (n.phr):a child (a student) who stays away from school withoutleave or permissionlurch (n):sudden movementhelter -skelter (adv) :in disorderly hasteheaved (v):uttered (a sigh)grunted (v):made a low, rough sound (expressing disagreement,boredom or irritation)dockyard (n):place where ships are built and repaired140English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

45,,The Storeyed House - II,"The news that Bayaji was building a storeyed house spread like a cry from the rooftops.There was only one storeyed house in the village and that belonged to Kondiba Patil. ThatBayaji, an untouchable creature, should think of a rival storeyed house was too much forKondiba to bear. Others also murmured that the untouchables were forgetting their position.Work on the foundation had started. Dattaram Vadar was given the contract ofconstruction. The foundation trenches were filled with mud, bits of stone and other fillings.Work progressed with speed. One day Bayaji saw Kondiba coming towards him and greetedhim.  'It's with your blessings that I have ventured on this storeyed house.' 'Baiju, you shouldn't lose your head simply because you've set aside some money.Do you aspire to an equal status with us by building this house? The poor should remaincontent with their cottage, understand?' Kondiba remarked rather sharply.142English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22 'No Patil, please don't misunderstand me.' Bayaji was a little dizzy with nervousness.  'How do you say that? One should keep to one's position. You shouldn't let a littlemoney turn your head.' 'I only wish to build a shelter for my family. Then I shall be free to breathe my last.'Bayaji answered. 'Who says you shouldn't have a house? You can have a small house with threeconvenient portions, a veranda in the front and at the back and the living section in themiddle. Why spend unnecessarily on a storeyed house?' Patil gave his counsel. 'No, but……' Bayaji faltered. 'You may go in for a storeyed house only if you don't wish to stay in this village. Ihope you know what I mean.' Kondiba shot out as a warning and walked away. Other ruffiansin the village threatened Bayaji in a similar manner.Out of fear Bayaji had to abandon plans for the storeyed house. The conventionalthree-portioned house was taken up. Work was resumed and the walls rose rapidly. Themiddle portion was a little elevated and a small first storey fixed up there with a woodenflooring. This part could be reached by stairs rising from the kitchen. No one could guessfrom outside that there was a first storey to the house. Bayaji had to make the best of things.The house was complete and the traditional housewarming ceremony was planned.Invitations were sent to relatives in    different villages. The village elders, by convention,could not be invited to a meal or refreshments, so they were invited to the ceremonialpaan-supari. Bayaji put up a fine pandal in front of the house. His sons worked hard fortwo full days on the decorations. Relatives started arriving. Well-known devotional singers,Kadegaonkar Buwa, Parasu Buwa, Kalekar Bapu Master, Jija Buwa and Vithoba of Wadgaoncame with their troupes. People looked forward with delight to the forthcoming contestamong the various troupes.In the evening four petromax lights were hung in the four corners of the pandal. Itlent a unique golden yellow light to the surroundings. Guests were engrossed in conversation.Kondiba Patil was soon there. With him was the thug Bhujaba and four or five seasonedrascals like Vithoba Ghayakute and Parasu Martanda. These people felt uneasy at the sightof the brand new house, the impressive pandal and the crowd of smiling faces.143English Class X143Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Their eyes roved all over the place. Bayaji led them up the stairs in the kitchen. Thefirst floor looked like a drawing room. The walls were radiant with blue oil-paint. The freshcolour gave out a pleasant smell. Framed pictures of great men like Lord Buddha, Dr.Babasaheb Amebedkar, Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and others hungon the walls. The loft-like first floor was filled with a pious and holy ambience.Bayaji spread a rough woollen carpet for Patil and the other high-caste people. Patilsat quietly on that. His companions, rather uncomfortable, took their positions around him;Bayaji offered them the customary betel leaves. Patil accepted the leaves but immediatelygave it back to Bayaji with the  remark, 'Yes, it's all very nice!' 'But why don't you accept the betel leaves?' Bayaji asked nervously. Bhujaba smiledartificially and said, 'It's enough that your offering is honoured; is it also necessary to eat it?We'll make a move now.' With this Kondiba Patil, Bhujaba and his companions rose toleave. As they came down, Bhujaba felt as if he were tumbling down the stairs.They eyed one another as if to say, 'This untouchable worm has got a swollen head.He needs proper handling.'Bayaji fed all his guests with meal of shira and puris. Along with betel nuts items ofgossip rolled over their tongues and then the session of social devotional songs began.Among the Bhajan singers, Kalekar Bapu Master has a superior voice. KadegaonkarBuwa was better at classical singing. Devotional songs were sung in praise of Dr.BabasahebAmbedkar and Lord Buddha. People swayed their heads in appreciation as the programmegathered momentum. It was two O' clock in the morning. Bayaji was strutting about in thepandal. He sat down by a guest now and then, to inquire after his welfare. Small children,unable to resist sleep, had dropped off like bundles of rags. Women sat in the front verandah.Bayaji's children were busy preparing tea for a second round. They had put tea powder andsugar into a pot on a trenched stove and waited for the water to boil. The bhajan was in  fullswing. 'I had a dream at night and my heart was full of feeling,' went the line.The group advanced from baseless devotionals - like 'From the east came a horde ofghosts, each one with seven heads' - to social devotionals.Kalekar Bapu Master's powerful voice rose up, `Take to heart the sweet advice ofBhimaraya and bow down to Buddha for the emancipation of the whole world. I fly to therefuge of Lord Buddha, I fly to the refuge of the Faith; I fly to the refuge of the Faithful.' Thesong rent the air, filling it with joy. And then the undreamt-of incident took place.144English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Bayaji's new house had caught fire from all sides. It had suddenly flared up. Thewomenfolk in the front verandah screamed in confusion. The guests stood up swiftly andbegan to pull out the women like a herd of cattle.Bayaji was frantic. He ran around crying, 'My house, my storeyed house! It's on fire.My enemy has taken revenge on me.' He entered the roaring flames, crying 'My House, myhouse.' He climbed up, pulled the pictures of Buddha and Babasaheb from the walls andhurled them down. As he was about to come down the stairs, it crumbled down in flames.People pulled up water from a nearby well to put out the dreadful fire but it could not beeasily contained. 'Bayaji, jump down, quick, jump,' people shouted. Women and childrenwere crying and screaming. Now that the staircase had collapsed, no one could go up.Scorched in the flames, Bayaji ran around like a trapped creature, howling all the time, 'Myhouse, my house!'And then the upper storey itself came down with a crash and along with it Bayaji,with a resounding thud. People pulled him out.Bayaji was burnt all over. He was still wailing, ‘My house’, ‘my house’! Bayaji'schildren encircled him and cried their hearts out.The guests were busy putting out the fire. All Bayaji's hopes had been reduced toashes. What was the use of putting out the fire now?145English Class X145Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Bayaji was badly burnt and he was in great agony.  He asked for water all the time. Ashis eyes began to roll in his head, his eldest son moved closer, gulped down the sorrow thatwas surging in his throat and asked, 'Nana, what's your last wish?''Sons, I want you to  build a storeyed house, I've no other wish.' With these words, hishead collapsed like the storeyed house. Bayaji was quiet and the fire too had calmed down.Bayaji's mother wept bitterly. 'Your father passed away without giving me a burial. Atleast your hands should have pushed the dust over my dead body. Bayaji, speak to me.' Shewas mad with grief.Bayaji's wife was sobbing her heart out, crying repeatedly, 'Who's done this evil tous? Let the house burn to cinders. Save my husband first!'The entire family was shattered by the calamity. The spirits of all the men weredampened like a cooking fire on which water has been poured.In the morning the village officers and witnesses visited the place to record the factsof the accident. 'Bayaji's death was the result of an accident due to a petromax flare-up,' wastheir conclusion.The house was burning before the house-warming ceremony was over and Bayajiwas in ashes in the cemetery instead of enjoying the comforts of a retired life.After the funeral, people returned hanging their heads. All of them were pained atheart to think that having come to celebrate the housewarming, they had the misfortune toattend the funeral of the host.All were sitting in a sullen mood in the pandal when Bayaji's eldest son came outwith three or four baskets, a spade, a pickaxe and a hoe. He outlined a square with thepickaxe and began to dig.The eldest son was digging, the second was gathering the earth with his spade and theothers were lifting it away in baskets.The guests asked in amazement, 'Children, you are in mourning!

Idioms cannot be translated word for word.They have become fixed through regular use with their figurative meanings. They should beused in their correct forms without dropping, adding or replacing any word. We cannot say'breathe one's first' to mean 'to take birth' or 'unbreathe one's last' in the sense of 'not to die'etc. Hence we should consult a standard dictionary and learn to use them as they are.A.

Government 2021-22Here are the words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on caste system. Read the textcarefully and make notes on it. Suggest a suitable title.There are other special features of the caste system which have their evil effects andwhich militate against Democracy. One such special feature of the caste system lies in itsbeing accompanied by what is called ""graded inequality"". Castes are not equal in their status.They are standing one above another. They are jealous of one another. It is an ascending anddescending scale of contempt. This feature of the caste system has most perniciousconsequences. It destroys willing and helpful co-operation.Caste and class differ in the fact that in the class there is no complete isolation asthere is in the caste system. This is the second evil effect in the caste system accompaniedby inequality. This manifests itself in the fact that the stimulus and response between twocastes is only one-sided. The higher caste act in one recognized way and the lower castemust respond in established way. It means that when there is no equitable opportunity toreceive the stimulus from and to return the response from different caste, the result is thatthe influence which educates some into masters, educates others into slaves. The experienceof each party loses its meaning when the free interchange of varying modes of life experienceis arrested. It results into a separation of society, into a privileged and a subject class. Sucha separation prevents endosmosis.There is the third characteristic of the caste system which depicts the evils thereofwhich cuts at the very roots of democracy. It is that one caste is bound to one occupation.Society is no doubt stably organized when each individual is   doing that for which he hasaptitude by nature in such a way as to be useful to others; and that it is the business ofsociety to discover these aptitudes and progressively to train them for social use. But thereis in a man an indefinite pluralities of capacities and activities which may characterize anindividual. Stratification is stunting of the growth of the individual and deliberate stunting isdeliberate denial of democracy.You can follow the following steps for note-making.•Read the passage thoroughly.•Underline the key points during the second reading.156English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

49,,Environment," (Interview with Wangari Maathai, Environmental Activist and Nobel Prize winner)Wangari Maathai started the Green Belt Movement and also fought for equal rightsfor women in Africa.  She is the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.  Readthe excerpts from her interview withNippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) Radio(Japan).NHK Radio : How did youbecome aware of the environment?Wangari Maathai: From thetime we started, we were trying torespond to the basic needs of peoplein the rural areas; and  people wereasking for clean drinking water, forfood, for energy (which is mostlyfirewood), for building material, for fodder for the animals.  And all these come from theland.  So we knew that what the people in the rural areas were asking for had to do with theenvironment.  They did not have those things because the environment was degraded.  So,from the very beginning we understood that we have to rehabilitate the environment.The forested mountains were the source of water and the source of rain, so when youdeforest, you cause a shortage of water and a change of rainfall patterns and therefore peopleare not able to get food and water.  Therefore, in order for them to have good environmentthat can sustain their livelihoods, it is important to have a government that accounts to them,that protects them, that protects their interests, that is concerned about their lives.NHK Radio : How is peace connected to a good environment?W M : Many wars that are fought in the world are fought over natural resources.Some wars are fought because the environment is so degraded that it is not able to supportcommunities and so they fight over the little that is left. Others are fought because somepeople want to take a lot of the resources, to control them, and to keep many other peopleout.166English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Now whether this happens at the national level or at the regional level, or even at theglobal level, sooner or later there is discontent; and when that discontent is strong enough,there is conflict.  So good management of the natural resources, equitable distribution ofthese resources, is important for peace.  At the same time, good management of the naturalresources is not possible if you do not have democratic space, respect for human beings,respect for human rights, giving other people dignity.That is why the three themes are related, like the African stool, with three legs andthe basin on which you sit.  The three legs: one leg is peace, the other leg is good governance,the third leg is sustainable management of resources.  When you have those three legs, nowyou can put the basin, which is development.  And if you try to balance that stool withoutthose three, it won't happen.We have not shared our resources equitably.  We have allowed some people,especially those in power, to acquire a lot at the expense of the majority.  And we have alsoengaged in conflict.NHK Radio : What was the environment like when you were young, and how did yougo about saving it?W M. : When I was a child, which is almost more than fifty years ago, the environmentwas very pristine, very beautiful, and very green.  We were a British colony, and the Britishgovernment at that time started to clear cut the indigenous forests in our forested mountainsbecause they wanted to establish commercial plantations of exotic species of trees such as166English Class X167Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22the pines from the northern hemisphere and theeucalyptus from Australia.  These trees are verynice, they grow tall, and they grow very fast, but asthey grow they destroy all the local biologicaldiversity.  All the flora and fauna disappeared.  Soalthough we were getting commercial timber forthe growing timber industry, we also destroyed ourlocal flora and fauna.As a result, these forests, which were thewater towers, were no longer able to contain thewater, so when the rains fell the water randownstream and ended up in the lakes and oceansinstead of going down into the undergroundreservoir so that it could come back to us in theform of rivers.  One thing we noted is that not onlydid the rain patterns change, became less, but also the rivers started drying up.  We lost ourlocal biological diversity.  So that's a lot of damage to our environment.That is why in 1975, at the very first United Nations Conference for Women inMexico, many of the women were saying, ""We need food, we need water, we need cleandrinking water, we need fodder for our animals.""   And I was wondering, what has happened?These are things that were there twenty years ago when I was a child.  The environment hadchanged; and that's when I started this campaign to restore the vegetation and to restore theland and to rehabilitate the forests.NHK Radio :  What happened when you started working with the women?W M.:  Well, the firsttime when I told them, ""Let usplant trees"", the women said theydid not know how to plant trees.So I asked the foresters tocome and teach them, but theywere very complicated-they areprofessionals.  It became verycomplicated for ordinaryilliterate women so I told thewomen, ""We shall use our168English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22common sense, and just do what wedo with other seeds.""  Women workon the farms.  They're the ones whoplant.  They're the ones whocultivate. They're the ones whoproduce food, so I told them thatseeds of trees are like any otherseeds.  So if they were to treat thesetree seeds the same way they treatother seeds of food crops, there isno difference.  I told them to lookfor old broken pots even and putseeds there.  They will germinate and they will know these are the seedlings from the seedsthey planted and we gave them plastic bags to be able to put those seedlings and to nurturethem and when they were about half a meter long then they could go and transplant them ontheir farms.In the beginning it was difficult, but they soon gained confidence and they becamevery competent foresters.  So I called them ""Foresters without Diplomas"".NHK Radio:  Why do you think they responded so well to your message?W M:  It was a need.  When the women said they needed firewood and buildingmaterial, we responded to that need.  Plant trees; then you will have trees for firewood.  Inthe tropics, trees grow very fast.  In five to ten years these trees serve as firewood, asbuilding materials.Once we had planted those trees, we saw the need for them to understand why wehave to have good governance; so it became important to give them civic education so thatthey could understand how we govern ourselves, why we govern ourselves the way we governourselves, why we are managing our environment the way we are managing it.  Because wewere dealing with the environment, we gave them education both in civics and also inenvironment.  That made them understand clearly why they should take up the responsibilityof protecting their environment-that it was not the responsibility of the government or theresponsibility of somebody else to come and rehabilitate their environment on their ownland.  It's them; it's their responsibility.NHK Radio :  What transformations did you see?168English Class X169Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22W M: One of the bigger transformations that I saw was that ability of an ordinary,illiterate woman to get to understand and to be able to plant trees that in five or ten yearsbecame big trees and she was able to cut them and be able to give herself energy; to be ableto sell those trees and give herself an income; to be able to feel confident that she had donesomething for herself.   That sense of pride, sense of dignity that they are not begging, thatthey are doing things for themselves was very empowering.  That transformation was verypowerful.The other is the transformation of the landscape.  Places where there was dust, thereare no more dust.  There are trees, even birds and rabbits.  They come back and they makethe environment very beautiful.   There is a shade and sometimes even dry springs comeback because the water is not running, the water is going into the ground.  Very profoundtransformation.And the other transformation that I saw was the willingness of the people to fight fortheir rights; to decide that they have a right to a good clean environment; to decide that theywill fight for their forests, they will protect their forests, and they will not allow corruptleaders to take their public land.NHK Radio :  How do you think you can influence the rest of Africa?W M: Our efforts will inspire other people to stop wasting their resources and theiryouth in wars and instead engage in creating a peaceful environment, more peaceful states.I'm very happy about the fact that now in Africa you see new efforts of ensuring thatAfricans engage in dialogue, that they invest in peaceful negotiations for conflicts, that wemanage our environment.  We must restore our environment and try to ensure that we donot fight, because we are allowing the environment, especially the land, to be degraded; andthen we fight over agricultural land and grazing land.  I see a lot of hope in what is happeningin Somalia, what is happening in the Sudan, what is happening in West Africa.  I see a lot ofAfrican leaders encouraging each other to engage in dialogue.NHK Radio :  What is the one thing we can do ?W M :  For me, my greatest activity is to plant a tree.  I think that a tree is a wonderfulsymbol for the environment and when we plant a tree we plant hope.  We plant the future forourselves, for our children, for the birds.  We plant something that will last, long after weare gone.

Non-finite clausesIn English we have two types of clauses : Finite clauses and non-finite clauses.Look at the following examples :1.  Wangari Maathai led the movement. She won the Nobel Prize.2.  Leading the movement, Wangari Maathai won the Nobel Prize.In the example 1, there are two sentences. Their is a verb in each sentence and eachverb has tense [a tense marker]. We can identify the tense of the verbs by looking at them,both of them are in past tense since they are written in ‘V2’. [‘led’ and ‘won’].  These arecalled ‘finite verbs’ as they have ‘tense’.Where as in example 2,  there are two clauses : ‘Leading the movement’ and ‘WangariMaathai’ won the Nobel Prize. The verb in the first class has no tense while the won in thesecond clause has tense [past tense].174English Class X175Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22The verb with tense is known as ‘finite verb’ and the clause that has a finite verb isknown as ‘finite clause’. In the same way, the verb that has ‘no’ tense is known as non-finiteverb [leading] and the clause is called ‘non-finite clause’.Non-finite clause depends on the finite clause for its tense.Leading the movement,   Wangari Maathai won the Nobel Prize  Non-finite clause  Finite clauseWe should note that a non-finite clause has no subject, and we only can decide thetense of a non-finite clause from the finite clause.A.  Underline the non-finite clauses in the following sentences.1. Born in London, he became the citizen of U.K.2. Having done his homework, he went out to play.3. Recognized by his boss, he got an appreciation letter.4. Encouraged by his father, Ravi got distinction in his final examination.5. With the tree grown tall, we get more shade.6. We left the room and went home to search for the books.7.  Do we have the money to buy that car?8. We were not able to get away until now.9. Having read the book, I returned it to the library.10. Jumping on his horse, the farmer rode to the market.B.  Observe how the following sentences have been rewritten to include non-finite clauses.1.Vincent Van Gogh, who was born in Holland in 1853, is one of the world's most famouspainters. Born in Holland in 1853, Vincent Van Gogh is one of the world's famous painters.2.Although his talent was unrecognized throughout his life, it was much appreciated afterhis death.176English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

After he had decided to become a painter, in about 1880, he started to paint studies ofpeasants and miners. 2. During the next few years, which are known as his 'Dutch period', he produced paintingswith rather dark greenish-brown colours.3. In 1886, when he went to Paris to visit his brother Theo, he was immediately attractedto the Impressionist work he saw there. He decided to stay in Paris and continued hispainting there.4. He was encouraged by Pissaro to use more colour in his pictures and his subsequentpaintings were bright and immensely colourful.5. After Van Gogh had moved to Arles in the south of France, in 1888, he worked frantically. 6. This frenzied activity, which was interrupted by bouts of deep depression and despair,produced the majority of his most famous paintings.7. One of these, which is called Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear, shows Van Gogh. He waswearing a bandage after he had cut off his ear. A year later, in 1890, he committed suicide.8. A lot is known about Van Gogh's life and his feelings because of the hundreds of letters,which were written by him to his brother Theo and others.9. His brother  always encouraged him in his work because he believed in Van Gogh'sgenius. He was the person closest to Van Gogh.II.Reported speechApart from the ground rules that are laid down for reporting in traditional grammarbooks, there are certain other principles that are to be followed to make the speech appealing.176English Class X177Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Suppose you want to tell somebody what Ram said. There are two ways of doingthis:You can repeat Ram's words (direct speech).Ram said, 'I am feeling ill.'Or you can use reported speech:Ram said that he was feeling ill.It is not always necessary to change the verb in reported speech. If you reportsomething and the situation hasn't changed, you need not change the verb to the past:Direct :Neelima said, 'My new job is very interesting.'Reported:Neelima said that her new job is very interesting.(The situation hasn't changed. Her job is still interesting.)Direct: Ravi said, 'I want to go to New York next year.'Reported:Ravi said that he wants to go to New York next year.(Ravi still wants to go to New York next year.)You can also change the verb to the past:Neelima said that her new job was very interesting.Ravi said that he wanted to go to New York the following year.The past simple (did/saw/knew etc.) can usually remain the same in reported speech,or you can change it into past perfect (had done/had seen/had known etc.):Direct:Ravi said: 'I woke up feeling ill, so I didn't go to work.""Reported:Ravi said (that) he woke up feeling ill, so he didn't go to work.or Ravi said (that) he had woken up feeling ill, so he hadn'tgone to work.178English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

Government 2021-22Read the  following essay and fill the columns in the table given after itwith the correct information.Pollution in India is very high and thus it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.The reasons for high pollution in India can be attributed to the fact that it is the largestemitter of carbon dioxide. Coal powered plants and increased number of vehicles on theroads are also increasing pollution. With the economy of India  growing, pollution in Indiais also growing.Air, water, environment, sound and soil can all be contaminated. Air contamination leads toair pollution. Similarly water pollution, environment pollution, sound pollution and soilpollution are caused due to the pollutants in them. Each of these pollutions will affect thepeople in their own ways.Air pollution: If the level of pollutants in the air is in  suchquantities that are injurious to human, animal and plant lifethen we can say air pollution has taken place. Air pollution iscaused due to a variety of reasons like increased number ofvehicles, smoke from burning fuels and factories.Industrialization and modernization are to be blamed for thepresent situation of air pollution. Industries such as thermalpower plants, cement, steel, refineries, petrochemicals andmines emit chemical pollutants into the air causing air pollution. The air pollution is causingreduction of  ozone layer which is important to protect earth from ultra  violet rays thatcome from the sun.Water Pollution: Water is being contaminated byvarious foreign matters. Water is thus losing itsquality. Water is polluted in various ways. It can bepolluted by industrial waste, agricultural waste, andlandfills. Nearly 80% of wastages from cities andtowns in India is diverted to rivers. In this way riversare getting polluted and water is becoming unfit for184English Class X185Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22usage by human beings. Aquatic animals are also dying due to this pollution. Sewerage wateris also directed into the rivers which cause development of various bacteria in the watermaking them not even suitable for bathing.Noise pollution: Noise pollution is mainly caused bytransportation and construction system. Noise pollutionnot only causes damage to the environment but showsnegative effect on human health. Human beings who areexposed to noise pollution  will develop high BP,stress,hearing loss, sleep disturbances and aggression. Usingnoise barriers, driving the vehicles slowly, using specialtyres etc can help lower sound pollution. The  problem of noise pollution should be paidmore attention. Though noise pollution is a major issue, no laws are existing in many citiesof the world to control it.Noise pollution in seas and oceans is also increasing due to ship traffic and oil drilling. Thisis affecting the hearing sense of animals.Soil pollution: Soil is being polluted by pesticides, oil and fuel dumping, landfill wastes,industrial wastes etc. Chemical wastes from factories are being directly dumped on the soiland it is contaminating the soil. Increasing urbanization, decrease in agricultural lands,increase in domestic wastage, agricultural activities, industrial activities are all contributingto soil pollution in India. Plastic factories, chemicalplants, oil refineries, animal farms, coal fired powerplants, nuclear waste, disposal activities are the mainsources of soil pollution. Effects of soil pollutionare dangerous. They may cause acid rains which cankill trees and other plants. It disrupts the balance ofnature. Soil pollution is also dangerous to wild life.Pesticides used more than required can damage thecrops and poison birds, animals and fishes.Sl.NoType ofpollutionCauses ofpollutionSources ofpollutionDamages causedby pollutionPossible solutionsor remedies186English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

The Nana family's housetoo, is the same as all the otherhouses in the village, with mudwalls and a rusting corrugated ironroof, and with children andchickens sharing the compound.There is one difference,however.  Outside Mr. Nana's front are three large empty metal drums, the bright red paintnow flaking away, but the skull and crossbones symbol clearly visible on each.  And in aclearing 200m away from the village, next to a stream that the villagers get their drinkingwater from, is an enormous pyramid of identical drums, reaching to the sky. Some of themare badly corroded, their slimy contents of various colours - grey, dark green, bright orange,etc. - leaking out, down, on to the baked African earth and into the stream.  Some have fallendown and rolled - or been rolled by playful children - into the bush. Some are smoking in themidday heat.  Some are swelling, as if their contents are bursting to get out.  Some havealready burst.“They came on a Wednesday,” said Sunday, “Many, many big lorries. They took allday unloading them.  No-one told us what was in them.  They gave the Chief a brown paperbag-I saw him smiling as the lorries drove away.  This was five years ago.  Then three monthsago, one of the brightest boys in the village - Thomas Agonyo - started university in Lagos.He came home one weekend with a new Chemistry book, and spent all day looking at thedrums and writing things down and talking to himself and shaking his head.   We all thoughthe had gone mad. Then he called a meeting of the village and told us that the drums contained186English Class X187Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22poisonous chemicals.

They havebeen in pain, terrible pain.  We have never seen deaths like that before.  Lots of our childrenare sick.  We have asked the Government to take the drums away, but they do nothing.  Wehave written to Italy, but they do nothing.  The Chief says we should move our houses toanother place.  But we have no money to buy land.  We have no choice.

Government 2021-22Read the following extract from Wings of Fire, where the former President ofIndia speaks of his childhood."
53,,My Childhood,"I was born into a middle - class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in theerstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen , had neither much formal education normuch wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a truegenerosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall theexact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders atewith us than all the members of our own family put together.I was one of the children - a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to talland handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of thenineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca  house , made of limestone and brick, on theMosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts andluxuries. However , all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes.In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.198English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22The Second World War  broke out in 1939, when I was eight years old. For reasonsI have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in themarket. I used to collect  the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. Aday's collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother -in-law Jallaluddinwould tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines inDinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the War. But soon Indiawas forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared.The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station.The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on theRameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin,who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram, to look for a helping hand to catch the bundlesand, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a centurylater, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics,  into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. Iinherited honesty and self-discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith ingoodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends198English Class X199Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22in my childhood - Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were fromorthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of us ever felt any difference amongstourselves because of our religious differences and upbringing. In fact, Ramanadha Sastrywas the son of Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Laterhe took over the priesthood of the Rameswaram temple from his father; Aravindan wentinto the business of arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasan became acatering contractor for the Southern Railways.During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony, our family used to arrangeboats with a special platform for carrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriagesite, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha which was near our house. Eventsfrom the Ramayana and from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories my motherand grandmother would tell the children in our family.One day when I was in the fifth standard at the Rameswaram Elementary School, anew teacher came to our class. I used to wear a cap which marked me as a Muslim, and Ialways sat in the front row next to Ramanadha sastry, who wore the sacred thread. The newteacher could  not stomach a Hindu priest's son sitting with a Muslim boy. In accordancewith our social ranking as the new teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench.I felt very sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry. He looked utterly downcast as I shifted to myseat in the last row. The image of him weeping when I shifted to the last row left a lastingimpression on me.After school, we went home and told our respective parents about the incident.Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he shouldnot spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocentchildren. He bluntly asked the teacher to either apologize or quit the school and the island.Not only did the teacher regret his behaviour but the strong sense of conviction LakshmanaSastry conveyed ultimately reformed this young teacher.On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram was very rigid in terms of thesegregation of different social groups. However, my science teacher Sivasubramania Iyer,though an orthodox Brahmin with a very conservative wife, was something of a rebel. Hedid his best to break social barriers so that people from varying backgrounds could mingleeasily. He used hours with me and would say, ""Kalam, I want you to develop so that you areon par with the highly educated people of the big cities.""200English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wife was horrified at the idea ofa Muslim boy being invited to dine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused to serve me inher kitchen. Sivasubramania Iyer was not perturbed, nor did he get angry with his wife, butinstead, served me with his own hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. His wifewatched us from behind the kitchen door. I wondered whether she had observed any differencein the way I ate rice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When I was leaving hishouse, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to join him for dinner again the next weekend.Observing my hesitation, he told not to get upset, saying, “Once you decide to change thesystem, such problems have to be confronted.” When I visited his house the next week,Sivasubramania Iyer’s wife took me inside her kitchen and served me food with her ownhands.Then the Second World War was over and India's freedom was imminent. ""Indianswill build their own India,"" declared Gandhiji. The whole country was filled with anunprecedented optimism. I asked my father for permission to leave Rameswaram and studyat the district headquarters in Ramanathapuram.He told me as if thinking aloud, ""Abul! I know you have to go away to grow. Does theseagull not fly across the sun, alone and without a nest?."" He quoted Khalil Gibran to myhesitant mother, ""Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters ofLife's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you.

55,,Unity in Diversity in India,"India, a country of many ethnic groups, is a land of myriad languages, a veritablebabel of tongues and numerous modes of apparel. For the most part, the continentaldimensions of the country account for these variations and diversities. Besides, there areseveral religions, sects and beliefs. But there are certain common links and uniting bondsthat people have sought to develop in order to achieve the eminently desirable goal of unityamidst diversity.It is true that superficial observers are likely to be bewildered by the astonishingvariety of Indian life. They fail to discover the one in many, the individual in the aggregate;the simple in the composite. With them the whole is lost in its parts. What is needed is thesuperior interpretation, synthesis of the power of the mind that can give rise to a vision ofthe whole.A keen penetrating insight will not fail to recognise the fundamental unity beneaththe manifold variety in India. The diversity itself, far from being a damaging cause of disunityand weakness, is a fertile source of strength and wealth. Sir Herbert Risely has rightlyobserved: ""Beneath the manifold diversity of physical and social types, languages, customsand religions which strike the observer in India, there can still be discerned a certain underlyinguniformity of life from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.""From his long and first-hand experience in India, Vincent A. Smith says that thecivilisation of India ""has many features which differentiate it from that of the other regions214English Class X215Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22of the world, while they are common to the whole country in degree sufficient to justify itstreatment as a unity in the history of human, social and intellectual development.""Even the early Indian history unmistakably shows that the political consciousness ofthe people has from the very early times, grasped the whole of India as a unit and assimilatedthe entire area as the theatre of its activities. India is not a mere geographical expression,nor is it a mere collection of separate people, traditions and conventions. India is muchmore than this. The best proof lies in the fact that Indian history has quickened into life.India has many races, castes, sub-castes, nationalities and communities, but the heartof India is one. We are all heirs to a common and rich culture. Our cultural heritage consistsof our art and literature as they flourished centuries ago. Our cultural heritage serves as abond of unity between people of different faiths and creeds.The streams of different cultures have flowed into our subcontinent to make us whatwe are and what we will be. There were Dravidians in India before the coming of the Aryansand Hinduism is a blend of the cultures of the North and the South.India has one hundred and fifty dialects, and twenty two recognised regional languages,but Hindi, like English, has come to stay as the lingua franca of our nation. From Kashmir toKanyakumari and from Mumbai to Nagaland, Hindi is now understood and is recognised asthe national language of India.216English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22India has a rich culturalheritage. We are inheritors ofseveral grand treasures in thefields of music, fine arts,dance, drama, theatre andsculpture. Our sages and seershave left behind a tradition ofpiety, penance, spiritualgreatness, conquest ofpassion, etc. Our scriptures arethe storehouses of spiritualwisdom. Our saints aspired tothe realisation of the infinite. We have inherited great spiritual values contrasted with whichthe materialistic progress of the West appears insignificant.The West has to learn a lot from India, and it has now been realised when people inthe United States and Europe are turning to the Indian way of life. Indian yogis and maharishis,musicians and spiritual leadershave all attracted them in a big way.A significant move to projectIndia's cultural unity has been theholding of Festivals of India invarious parts of the world. TheWest is fast inclining towards ourspiritual values which includemeditation and contemplation,charity and love, universalbrotherhood and fear of God, pietyand unselfishness, control of passions and peace of mind.Our cultural unity is further exemplified by the temples of theSouth and of Khajuraho, the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, which areshining examples of India's proficiency in sculpture and architecture.Our music has come to enjoy worldwide popularity.Indian classical music, like the Indian dances, is built on theconcept of ragas and talas. Each raga is regarded appropriate to a certaintime of the day or the night. There are believed to be about 250 ragasin common use in the North as well as in the South. In the modern216English Class X217Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22times, people like Ravi Shankarhave taken Indian music to theWest and thus bridged the gapbetween the music of the Eastand the West.Other significantfeatures of India's cultural unityare the variety, colour and theemotional richness of itsdances. The country abounds in tribal dances, old-dances as well as classical dances ofgreat virtuosity. Throughout India, dance is regarded not merely as an accompaniment tosocial intercourse, but also as a mode of aesthetic expression and spiritual realization.The great symbol of dance is Shiva, the Cosmic Dancer, depicted in sculpture andpoetry as Nataraja. Similarly, the classical theatre in India has a history of more than twothousand years. It was performed in palaces and in temples. The classical plays combinedmusic and dance.

61,,Jamaican Fragment,"Everyday, I walk a half-mile from my home to the tramcar lines in the morning andfrom the lines to my home in the evening. The walk is pleasant. The road on either side isflanked by red and green-roofed bungalows, green lawns and gardens. The exercise is goodfor me, and now and then, I learn something from a little incident. One morning, about half-way between my front gate and the tram track, I noticed two little boys playing in the gardenof the more modest cottages. They were both very little boys, one was four years old perhaps,the other five. The bigger of the two was a sturdy youngster, very dark, with a mat of coarsehair on his head and coal-black eyes. He was definitely a little Jamaican — a strong littleJamaican. The other little fellow was smaller, but also sturdy — he was white, with hazeleyes and light-brown hair. Both were dressed in blue shirts and khaki pants. They wore noshoes and their feet were muddy. They were not conscious of my standing there, watchingthem; they played on. The game, if it could be called a game, was not elaborate. The littlewhite boy strode imperiously up and down, and every now and then shouted imperiously athis bigger playmate. The little brown boy shuffled along quietly behind him and did what hewas told.226English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22'Pick up that stick!' The dark boy picked it up. 'Jump into the flowers!' The dark boyjumped.'Get me some water!' The dark boy ran inside. The white boy sat down on the lawn.I was amazed. Here before my eyes, a white baby, for they were little more thanbabies, was imposing his will upon a little black boy. And the little black boy submitted. Ipuzzled within myself as I went down the road. Could it be that the little dark boy was the sonof a servant in the home and therefore had to do the white boy's bidding? No. They wereobviously dressed alike, the little dark boy was of equal class with his playmate. No. Theywere playmates, the little dark boy was a neighbour's child. I was sure of that. Then how wasit that he obeyed so faithfully the white boy's orders?Was it that even as a boy he sensed that in his own country he would be at the whiteman's beck and call? Could he, at his age, divine a difference between himself and the whiteboy? And did the little white youngster, so young, such a baby, realize that he would grow todominate the black man? Was there an indefinable quality in the white man that enabled hisbaby, smaller and younger than his playmate, to make him his slave? I could find no answer.I could not bring myself to believe such a thing, and yet, with my own eyes I had seen a littledark boy take orders from a little white boy — a little white boy, obviously his social equal,and younger and smaller. Were we, as a race, really inferior? So inferior that even in ourinfancy we realised our deficiencies, and accepted a position as the white man's servant?226English Class X227Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22For a whole day I puzzled over this problem. For a whole day my faith in my peoplewas shaken. When I passed by that afternoon the little boys were not there. That evening Ithought deeply on the subject.The next morning the boys were there again, and a man was standing at the gatewatching them. I stopped and looked, just to see what the white boy was making his littleservant do. To my utter astonishment the little dark boy was striding imperiously up anddown the lawn, while the white youngster walked abjectly behind him.'Get me a banana!' The little boy ran into the house and reappeared shortly with abanana. 'Peel it for me!' the little white boy peeled the banana and handed it to his darkmaster.I saw it now. It was indeed a game, a game I had played as a child. Each boy took it inturn every alternate day to be the boss, the other the slave. It had been great fun to me as ayoungster. I smiled as I remembered. I looked at the man standing by the gate. He was awhite man. I remembered what I had thought yesterday. He, no doubt, I thought to myself,was wondering if the black race is superior to the white. I laughed gently to myself. Howsilly grown-ups are, how clever we are, how wonderfully able we are, to impute deep motivesto childish actions! This man, I said to myself, will puzzle all day on whether the blacks willeventually rise and rule the world because he thinks he sees a little black boy realizing at atender age his superiority over the white. I will save him from his puzzle. I will explain it tohim. I went across to him.'I know what you're thinking,' I said. 'You're thinking that may be the black race issuperior to the white, because you just saw the little dark youngster on the lawn orderingthe little white boy around. Don't think that; it's a game they play. Alternate days one is theboss, the other the servant. It's a grand game. I used to play it and may be so did you. YesterdayI saw the little white boy bossing the dark one and I worried all day over the dark boy'srealisation of his inferiority so young in life! We are silly, we grown-ups, aren't we?'The man was surprised at my outburst. He looked at me smiling. 'I know all about thegame,' he said. 'The boys are brothers — my sons.' He pointed to a handsome brown womanon the verandah who had just come out to call in the children. 'That's my wife', he said.I smiled. My spirit laughed within me. This is Jamaica, I said in my heart, this is mycountry — my people. I looked at the white man. He smiled at me. 'We'll miss the tram if wedon't hurry,' he said.By A.L.Hendricks228English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

The physical education teacher started singing the praises of Sunitha saying,""You know, she runs like a hare and swims like a fish.  And in the boxing ring?  She is aleopard. I must say she is the Mary Kom of our state."" Unlike other teachers, the socialstudies teacher hated this girl as Sunitha belonged to the so-called 'lower caste'.

63,,What Is My Name?,"Have you noticed how your father calls your mother? Does he use her name ornot? How do the neighbours address her? Does anyone address her by name? Whatabout your grandmother? In this story, P. Sathyavathi describes how a woman forgetsher own name since no one addresses her by name. How does a woman gain her identity—by name, by marriage, by motherhood, by education, by profession or by anything else?Read the story keeping these questions in mind.A young woman, before being a housewife. A woman, educated and cultured, andintelligent, and capable, quick-witted, with a sense of humour and elegance.Falling for her beauty and intelligence, as also the dowry which her father offered, ayoung man tied the three sacred knots around her neck, made her the housewife to a householdand said to her, 'Look, ammadu, this is your home.' Then the housewife immediately pulledthe end of her sari and tucked it in at the waist and swabbed the entire house and decorated240English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22the floor with muggulu designs. The young man promptly praised her work. 'You are dexterousat swabbing the floor — even more dexterous in drawing the muggulu. Sabash, keep it up.'He said it in English, giving her a pat on the shoulder in appreciation. Overjoyed, thehousewife began living with swabbing as the chief mission in her life. She scrubbed thehouse spotlessly clean at all times and beautifully decorated it with multi-coloured designs.That's how her life went on, with a sumptuous and ceaseless supply of swabbing cloths andmuggu baskets.But one day while scrubbing the floor, the housewife suddenly asked herself, 'Whatis my name?' The query shook her up. Leaving the mopping cloth and the muggu basketthere itself, she stood near the window scratching her head, lost in thoughts. 'What is myname — what is my name?' The house across the road carried a name-board, Mrs M Suhasini,M.A., Ph.D., Principal, 'X' College. Yes, she too had a name as her neighbour did — 'Howcould I forget like that? In my scrubbing zeal I have forgotten my name — what shall I donow?' The housewife was perturbed. Her mind became totally restless. Somehow she finishedher daubing for the day.Meanwhile, the maidservant arrived. Hoping at least she would remember, thehousewife asked her, 'Look, ammayi, do you know my name?''What is it, amma?' said the girl. 'What do we have to do with names of mistresses?'You are only a mistress to us — the mistress of such and such a white-storeyed house,ground floor means you.'''Yes, true, of course, how can you know, poor thing?' thought the housewife.The children came home from school for lunch in the afternoon. 'At least the childrenmight remember my name' — the housewife hoped.'Look here, children, do you know my name?' she asked.They were taken aback.'You are amma — your name is amma only — ever since we were born we haveknown only this, the letters that come are only in father's name — because everyone callshim by his name we know his name — you never told us your name — you don't even getletters addressed to your name,' the children said plainly. 'Yes, who will write letters to me?'Father and mother are there but they only make phone calls once in a month or two. Even mysisters are immersed with swabbing their houses. Even if they met me in some marriage orkumkum ceremony, they chatted away their time talking about new muggulu or new dishesto cook, but no letters!' The housewife was disappointed and grew more restless — the urgeto know her own name somehow or the other grew stronger in her.240English Class X241Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Now a neighbour came to invite her to a kumkum ceremony. The housewife askedher neighbour hoping she atleast would remember her name. Giggling, the lady said,'Somehow or other I haven't asked your name nor have you told me. Right -hand side, whitestoreyed - house or there she is, that pharmaceutical company manager's wife, if not that,that fair and tall lady, that’s how we refer to you, that's all.' That's all that the other housewifecould say.It’s no use. What can even my children's friends say —  they know me only as Kamala'smother or some aunty, now my respected husband — is the only hope —  if anyone remembersit, it is only he.During the night meal, she asked him, 'Look here, I have forgotten my name — ifyou remember it, will you please tell me?'The respected husband burst out laughing and said, 'What is it, dear, never has ithappened before, you are talking about your name today. Ever since we were married I havegot used to calling you only as yemoi. You too never told me not to address you that waybecause you have a name of your own — what's happened now — Everyone calls you MrsMurthy, don't they?’‘Not Mrs Murthy, I want my own name — what shall I do now?' she said in anguish.'What's there, you choose a new name, some name or other,' the husband advised.‘Very nice — your name is Satyanarayana Murthy; will you keep quiet if I ask you tochange your name to Siva Rao or Sundara Rao? I want my name only,' she said.'It's all right, you are an educated woman — your name must be on the certificates —don't you have that much common sense — go and find out,' he advised her .The housewife searched frantically for her certificates in the almirah — pattu saris,chiffon saris, handloom saris, voile saris, matching blouses, petticoats, bangles, beads, pearls,pins, kumkum barinas, silver plates, silver containers to keep sandalwood paste, ornamentsall things arranged in an orderly fashion. Nowhere could she find her certificates. Yes —after marriage she had never bothered to carry those certificates here.'Yes — I haven't brought them here — I shall go to my place, search for my certificatesand enquire about my name, and return in a couple of days.' She asked for her husband'spermission. 'Very nice! Must you go just for your name or what? If you go, who will scrubthe house these two days?' said her lord. Yes, that was true — because she scrubbed betterthan the others. She had not allowed anyone else to do that job all these days. Everyone wasbusy with their own respective duties. He had his office — poor things, the children had242English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22their studies to take care of. Why should they bother about this chore, and she had beendoing it all along — they just didn't know how to do it, of course.But still, how to live without knowing one's name? It was all right all these days sincethe question had not occurred to her; now it was really hard to live without a name.'Just for two days you manage somehow or other — until and unless I go and get myname,  I shall find it difficult to live,' she pleaded with her husband and managed to get out ofthe house.'Why, dear daughter, have you come so suddenly? Are your children and husband allright? Why have you come alone?'Behind affectionate enquiries of the father and the mother there was a strain ofsuspicion. Recollecting immediately the purpose of her visit, the housewife asked her mothermost pitifully, 'Amma, tell me, what is my name?''What is it amma, you are our elder daughter. We gave you education up to B.A. andgot you married with fifty thousand rupees as dowry. We took care of your two deliveries—  each time we alone bore the expenses of the maternity home. You have two children —your husband has a good job — a very nice person, too — your children are well-mannered.''It's not my history, amma — it's my name I want. At least tell me where mycertificates are.''I don't know, child. Recently we cleaned out the almirah of old papers and files andarranged some glassware in their place. Some important files we kept in the attic — weshall search for them tomorrow. Now what is the hurry, don't worry about them — take agood bath and have your meal, child,' said the housewife's mother.The housewife took a good bath and ate her meal, but she could not sleep. Whilescrubbing the house, humming happily, joyously, and making muggulu, she had never thoughtthat she would have to face so many difficulties like this by forgetting her own name.Dawn broke, but the search for the certificates among the files in the attic had notended.Now the wife asked everyone she met — she asked the trees — the anthills — thepond — the school where she had studied — the college. After all the shouting and thewailing, she met a friend — and succeeded in recovering her name.That friend was also like her — married, and a housewife like her, but she had notmade swabbing the sole purpose of her life; scrubbing was only a part of her life; sheremembered her name and the names of her friends. This particular friend recognized ourhousewife.242English Class X243Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22'Sarada! My dear Sarada!' she shouted and embraced her. The housewife felt like aperson — totally parched and dried up, about to die of thirst — getting a drink of cool waterfrom the new earthen kooja poured into her mouth with a spoon and given thus a new life.The friend did indeed give her a new life — 'You are Sarada. You came first in our school inthe tenth class. You came first in the music competition conducted by the college. You usedto paint good pictures too. We were ten friends altogether — I meet all of them some timeor other. We write letters to each other. Only you have gone out of our reach! Tell me whyare you living incognito?' her friend confronted her. 'Yes, Pramila — what you say is true. Of course I'm Sarada — until you said it Icould not remember it — all the shelves of my mind were taken up with only one thing —how well I can scrub the floors. I remembered nothing else. Had I not met  you, I would havegone mad,' said the housewife named Sarada.Sarada returned home, climbed the attic and fished out her certificates, the picturesshe had drawn — old albums, everything she succeeded in getting out. She also searchedfurther and managed to find the prizes she had received in school and college.Overjoyed, she returned home.'You have not been here — look at the state of the house — it's like a choultry. Ohwhat a relief you are here, now it is like a festival for us,' said Sarada's husband.244English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22Smt  P.

And then he went away. That night the farmer couldn't sleep.He was unhappy and he was discontent. He was unhappy because he was discontentand discontent because he was unhappy. The next morning he made arrangements to selloff his farm, took care of his family and went in search of diamonds. He looked all overAfrica and couldn't find any. He looked all through Europe and couldn't find any. Whenhe got to Spain, he was emotionally, physically and financially broke. He got so disheartenedthat he threw himself into the Barcelona river and committed suicide.Back home, the person who had bought his farm was watering the camels at astream that ran through the farm. Across the stream, the rays of the morning sun hit a stoneand made it sparkle like a rainbow. He thought it would look good on the mantel piece.He picked up the stone and put it in the living room. That afternoon the wise man cameand saw the stone sparkling. He asked, ""Is Hafiz back?"" The new owner said, ""No, whydo you ask?"" The wise man said, ""Because that is a diamond. I recognize one when I seeone."" The man said, “No, that's just a stone I picked up from the stream. Come, I'll showyou. There are many more.” They went and picked some samples and sent them foranalysis. Sure enough, the stones were diamonds. They found that the farm was indeedcovered with acres and acres of diamonds."

It has witnessed culturalreforms. It is the birth place of many writers and intellectuals.To Continue  this tradition, another great son of India took birth in Calcutta  on 2ndMay 1921. Who could that be? It is none other than Satyajit Ray, the son of a writer. . .  agrandson of an amateur astronomer. His home provided him with an ambience to think andfeel. Graduating from Presidency College, Calcutta, Ray  moved  to the open airuniversity, 'Shantiniketan'. A keen observer that he was, Ray imbibed the spirit ofShantiniketan. There he  read extensively and developed interest in painting.Back in Calcutta, Ray started working for a London-based advertising firm.  Wasn'tit a right place for a creative man like Ray? He worked there for some time and moved toLondon to work there.252English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22 There he watched films. Film after film. He liked the film 'Bicycle Thieves'. Thatkindled interest in Young Ray in film-making. Slowly his interest led him to a world ofcreativity. That was the birth of a great film maker. And Ray became a film maker.His films 'Pather Panchali', 'Aparajito', 'Agantuk' were some of his master pieces.His vision for Bengali films was matchless.Along with the Oscar Award, he received the Bharata Ratna. The legendary filmmaker passed away  in 1992. But the film world cherishes his memories forever.Next week we will know about another great personality.Till then, good bye."
68,,A Speech by Martin Luther King Jr.,"I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of themoment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaningof its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slavesand the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table ofbrotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state swelteringwith the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom andjustice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where theywill not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips arepresently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformedinto a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with littlewhite boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountainshall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will bemade straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see ittogether.This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the south. With this faithwe will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith wewill be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony ofbrotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray  together, to struggletogether, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will befree one day.253253English Class XFree distribution by T.S.

69,,A Talk by an Environmentalist,"As you all know, to the North of India we have snow-covered mountain ranges asboundaries to our country. They are the Himalayas. You know the Himalayas are alsoaffected by the environmental pollution. You must be wondering as to how the  Himalayasget affected. The Himalayas are huge, cool ice formations surrounded by beautifulhabitation. Do you know what happens if the Himalayas die? The whole of India will turninto a desert. Can you guess what felling of trees leads to? It leads to deforestation.Specially in the Himalayan region if the trees in the forest are cut down that will give wayfor warming of the atmosphere and with the result melting of Himalayas.Do you know when the movement for the protection of the Himalayas started? Itstarted way back in 1970s and 1980s. The movement was for the resistance to thedestruction of forests throughout India. Later it became organized and known as Chipkomovement.The architect of the movement to protect the Himalayas is a renowned person -Sunderlal Bahuguna. He was the follower of Mahatma Gandhi in many ways. He startedthe movement to resist the destruction of forests in the Himalayan region.Do you know how the movement got its name? The name (Chipko) came from aword meaning 'embrace'. In the movement, the villagers hugged the trees and thus savedthem by putting their bodies in the way of the contractors' axes."
70,,A Speech by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,"Dear friends,“I have three visions for India. In 3000 years of our history, people from all overthe world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. FromAlexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Moghuls, the Portuguese, the British, theFrench , the Dutch , all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we havenot done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbedtheir land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why?Because we respect the freedom of others.That is why my first vision is that of freedom. I believe that India got its first visionof this in 1857, when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we mustprotect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My secondvision for India is development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It’stime we saw ourselves as a developed nation. We are among top 5 nations of the worldin terms of GDP. We have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are254English Class XFree distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22falling. Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack the selfconfidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t thisincorrect?.I have a third vision. India must stand up to the world because I believe that unlessIndia stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. Wemust be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must gohand-in-hand . My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. VikramSarabhai of the Dept. of Space, Prof. Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. BrahmPrakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of themclosely and consider this the great opportunity of my life…Why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so embarrassed torecognize our own strengths, our achievements? We are such a great nation. We have somany amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why? We are the firstin milk production. We are number one in Remote sensing satellites. We are the secondlargest producer of wheat and rice. Look at Dr. Sudarshan, he has transformed the tribalvillage into a self-sustaining, self driving unit. There are millions of such achievementsbut our media is only obsessed with failures and disasters…"

Creative Expression (Oral and Written Discourses)In order to achieve the above learning outcomes, the new textbooks have eight units with differentthemes and genres.Features of  the  TextbookThe following are the features of the Textbook: Units are thematically organized with passages meant for listening and reading.  Activities focus onreading comprehension,  vocabulary, grammar and study skills. Measures have been taken to help learners get the rules familiarised with different genres  such asnarratives, essays, biographical sketches, plays, poems, etc. and construct them in oral as well aswritten forms. Though the components in a unit have been organised as listening, speaking (oral activity), readingand writing, an integrated treatment of these skills has been worked out. Vocabulary and grammar exercises have been contextually designed. A few questions and activities, given under comprehension, do not target  any fixed responses;instead, they demand the learners to use language authentically both  orally and in writing. Thesecomprehension questions and the language activities are merely stepping stones for the learners togain proficiency in the  language and as such are not goals by themselves.Components of a UnitFace Sheet / Trigger: Each unit starts with a picture / quotation / poem followed by some interactivequestions.

Assessment is not an activity distinct from learning.Since learning is facilitated through group discussions, pair discussions and individually, assessment alsooperates at the individual level, in peers and in groups. This will help the learners to compare theirstrengths and weaknesses and make modifications in their learning. We propose Continuous andComprehensive Assessment at all levels of language learning.257Free distribution by T.S.

The questions in the examination papershall not simply be based on information given in the textbooks but shall create slots for thelearner to use language in a meaningful way applying what she has learnt. So ‘mugging up’ by thestudent will not be of any use to him or her.Types of AssessmentThere are two types of assessment. - 1. Formative Assessment  2. Summative AssessmentGuidelines for Formative AssessmentFormative assessment is done based on four tools that cover all the language competencies(Academic Standards). These are:1. Read and Reflect2. Written Works3. Project Work4.  Slip TestTeacher has to assess the performance of the learners for each term. 20 marks allotted forFormative test in which 5 marks are allotted for each tool. This is not a single day activity; it is acumulative account of what has happened in day- to-day class room transaction.Criteria for awarding marks under each tool:Read and Reflect : The child has to read one reading text (other than text book) such as story,news report, article etc. Children have to read, comprehend and express their opinion in oral andwritten.  The oral and written reflections are the evidences for awarding marks.Written Works : This is with regard to: 1. Exercises given in the text book, 2. Discoursesassigned to individuals during classroom transaction. 3. Answers to a few extrapolating questions.The facilitator has to go through the written works and award marks based on the children’sperformance in view of the presentation of their own thoughts with well formed sentences.The child has to maintain 2 note books.  The first one is meant for read and reflect, projectwork and slip test. The second one is exclusively for written works.Projects: The oral and written performance of children which cover all the academic standards/ learning outcomes should be considered while awarding marks in various stages i.e.  planning,execution, analysis and interpretation of data, report writing and presentation with feedback.Slip Test: This test should be conducted without giving any prior notice to children. This testshould cover the targeted discourses (by taking two / three targeted discourses  in  each formativeassessment). This practice will help children in attempting the written discourses in SummativeTests successfully. The teacher may conduct the slip test for 20 marks so as to cover more numberof questions.  Finally it has to be reduced to 5 marks.Teacher’s unit cum period plan should reflect children’s oral performance.Summative AssessmentThere will be a Summative Assessment after every term. The test is for 100 marks. Out ofthese, 20 marks are allotted for Formative assessment and 80 marks are allotted for written test.The average marks of Formative 1 and 2 should be added to first Summative-I. Theaverage marks of four Formative tests should be added to final Summative-II (Public exam).As CCE is a school based assessment, every school should prepare their own questionpapers for summative assessment.258English Class XFree distribution by T.S.
