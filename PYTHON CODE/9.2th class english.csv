5,,Preface,"The State Council of Educational Research and Training has developed the StateCurriculum Framework - 2011 and Position Papers in tune with the National CurriculumFramework - 2005 and the Right to Education Act - 2009.  Accordingly a new set of textbookshas been designed to be introduced in a phased manner.  In the year 2012-13, the first of thisseries of textbooks has developed for classes I, II, III, VI, and VII. In the year 2013-14 forthe remaining classes IV, V, VIII and IX  textbooks have developed. Practicing teachershave been involved in the production of the textbooks along with the state level and nationallevel experts.Hitherto, English was introduced in Non-English Medium Schools in class III. The StateGovernment introduced English for the first time in class  I in 2011-12 in all Non-EnglishMedium Schools also. In the year 2012-13, English has been introduced  in class II in allNon-English Medium Schools. With this, all classes from I to X will have English as one ofthe subjects, irrespective of the medium of instruction. Therefore, in order to have parityamong students of English and non- English medium, a common English textbook wasintroduced in all media from June 2012. Moreover, since IT enabled learning, multilingualism,and language across the curriculum would greatly enhance the child's learning, it would not bea problem for the non- English medium child to learn English as effectively as the child inEnglish medium does. This single textbook norm is already in practice in many states includingTamilnadu, Bihar, and Kerala. Further, students of all media have a common English Textbookat Intermediate level in our state.This textbook, “Our World through English” class IX,  is an integrated one in thesense it has The Main Reader component, The Supplementary  Reader component and TheWorkbook component interwoven into a single textbook.  Hence, these components arefound in each and every unit.  The language skills  listening, speaking, reading, and writing areintegrated in the larger context of the themes as suggested in NCF - 2005. The activities areso designed as to ensure the holistic treatment of language.Inclusion of Gender Sensitivity and Child Sexual Abuse in School Text Books publishedby School Education Department with support of UNICEF is taken up to ensure protectionof children through various interventions like personal safety rules, gender sensitivity, childsexual abuse, self esteem and life skills. In these areas safety mechanisms and laws related tochild protection are taken care of. Hence, the teachers must know about these things andbring awareness among all the stakeholders.The main aim of teaching English is to help learners evolve themselves as independentusers of English.  I hope this textbook will help teachers and students achieve this by makingthe teaching-learning process effective.I thank all the institutions and experts at the state and national level, the members of theTextbook Production  and Development Committees, the staff members of  the SCERT, T.S.Hyderabad and all others who have contributed directly or indirectly for the successfulproduction of this textbook.Any suggestions for the improvement of this book are welcome.DirectorSCERT., Hyderabad.12-11-2012HyderabadIV"

15,,Humour,Look at the picture and answer the questions that follow.
16,,,"3   “Has a snake ever coiled itself round any part of your body? A full-blooded cobra?” Allof us fell silent. The question came from the homeopath. The topic came up when we werediscussing snakes. We listened attentively as the doctor continued with the tale.“It was a hot summer night about ten o’ clock. I had my meal at the restaurant and returnedto my room. I heard a noise from above as I opened the door. The sound was a familiar one.One could say that  rats and I shared the room. I took out my box of matches and lighted thekerosene lamp on the table.The house was not electrified; it was a small rented room. I had just set up medicalpractice and my earnings were meagre. I had about sixty rupees in my suitcase. Along withsome shirts and dhotis, I also possessed one solitary black coat which I was then wearing.I took off my black coat, white shirt and not-so-white vest and hung them up. I openedthe two windows in the room. It was an outer room with one wall facing the open yard. It hada tiled roof with long supporting gables that rested on the beam over the wall. There was noceiling. There was a regular traffic of rats to and from the beam. I made my bed and pulledit close to the wall. I lay down but I could not sleep. I got up and went out to the veranda fora little air, but the wind god seemed to have taken time off.I went back into the room and sat down on the chair. I opened the box beneath the tableand took out a book, The Materia Medica. I opened it at the table on which stood the lampand a large mirror; a small comb lay beside the mirror."
17,,The Snake and the Mirror,
18,,,"4   One feels tempted to look into a mirror when it is near. I took a look. In those days I wasa great admirer of beauty and I believed in making myself look handsome. I was unmarriedand was a doctor. I felt I had to make my presence felt. I picked up the comb and ran itthrough my hair and adjusted the parting so that it looked straight and neat. Again I heard thatsound from above.I took a close look at my face in the mirror. I made an important decision – I wouldshave daily and grow a thin moustache to look more handsome. I was, after all, a bachelor,and doctor!I looked into the mirror and smiled. It was an attractive smile. I made another earth-shaking decision. I would always keep that attractive smile on my face . . . to look morehandsome. I was after all a bachelor, and doctor too on top of it!Again came that noise from above.I got up, lit a beedi and paced up and down the room. Then another lovely thought struckme. I would marry. I would get married to a woman doctor who had plenty of money and agood medical practice. She had to be fat; for a valid reason. If I made some silly mistake andneeded to run away, she should not be able to run after me and catch me!With such thoughts in my mind I resumed my seat in the chair in front of the table. Therewere no more sounds from above. Suddenly there came a dull thud as if a rubber tube hadfallen to the ground. . . surely nothing to worry about. Even so I thought I would turn aroundand take a look. No sooner had I turned than a fat snake wriggled over the back of the chairand landed on my shoulder. The snake’s landing on me and my turning were simultaneous."
19,,,"5   I didn’t jump. I didn’t tremble. I didn’t cry out. There was no time to do any such  thing.The snake slithered along my shoulder and coiled around my left arm above the elbow. Thehood was spread out and its head was hardly three or four inches from my face!It would not be correct to say merely that I sat there holding my breath. I was turned tostone. But my mind was very active. The door opened into darkness. The room was surroundedby darkness. In the light of the lamp, I sat there like a stone image in the flesh.I felt then the great presence of the Creator of this world and this universe. God wasthere. Suppose I said something and he did not like it. I tried in my imagination to write inbright letters outside my little heart the words ‘O God!’.There was some pain in my left arm. It was as if a thick leaden rod – no, a rod made ofmolten fire – was slowly but powerfully crushing my arm. The arm was beginning to bedrained of all strength. What could I do?At my slightest movement the snake would strike me! Death lurked four inches away.Suppose it struck, what was the medicine I had to take? There were no medicines in theroom. I was but a poor, foolish and stupid doctor. I forgot my danger and smiled feebly atmyself.It seemed as if God appreciated that. The snake turned its head. It looked into the mirrorand saw its reflection. I do not claim that it was the first snake that had ever looked into amirror. But it was certain that the snake was looking into the mirror. Was it admiring its ownbeauty? Was it trying to make an important decision about growing a moustache or usingeye shadow and mascara or wearing a vermilion spot on its forehead?"
20,,,"6   I did not know anything for certain. What sex was the snake, was it male or female? I willnever know; for the snake unwound itself from my arm and slowly slithered into my lap.From there it crept onto the table and moved towards the mirror. Perhaps it wanted to enjoyits reflection at closer quarters.I was no mere image cut in granite. I was suddenly a man of flesh and blood. Still holdingmy breath I got up from the chair. I quietly went out through the door into the veranda. Fromthere I leapt into the yard and ran for all I was worth.”“Phew!” Each of us heaved a sigh of relief. All of us lit beedis. Somebody asked, “Doctor,is your wife very fat?”“No,” the doctor said. “God willed otherwise. My life companion is a thin reedy personwith the gift of a sprinter.”Someone else asked, “Doctor, when you ran, did the snake follow you?”The doctor replied, “I ran and ran till I reached a friend’s house. Immediately I smearedoil all over myself and took a bath. I changed into fresh clothes. The next morning at abouteight-thirty I took my friend and one or two others to my room to move my things fromthere. But we found we had little to carry. Some thief had removed most of my things. Theroom had been cleaned out! But not really, the thief had left behind one thing as a finalinsult!”“What was that?” I asked.The doctor said, “My vest, the dirty one. The fellow had such a sense of cleanliness . . .!The rascal could have taken it and used it after washing it with soap and water.”“Did you see the snake the next day, doctor?”The doctor laughed, “I’ve never seen it since. It was a snake which was taken with its ownbeauty!”Vaikom Muhammad Basheer (21 January 1908 – 5 July1994) was a Malayalam fiction writer from the state of Keralain India.

Suggest a suitabletitle for it.The young doctor married an intelligent and kind girl. He told her the episode of ‘TheSnake and the Mirror’. She laughed heartily. He went on talking about cobras and somefunny facts (associated) related to them. He said to her, “Cobras are the most poisonous,active and dangerous snakes. But, surprisingly, most Hindus worship them. It is funny toknow that some women drop eggs and pour milk into the ant hills where cobras usuallyreside.It is funny to know that some people believe cobras dance to the tunes of charmers. Infact, they have no ears. It is equally humorous to be aware of the fact that most cobra victimsgo to the charmers instead of the doctors. The charmers enchant some so-called mantrastaking some neem leaves into their hands. The cobra victim dies and they say the victimcame late to them. It is funnier to know that some farmers cremate cobras and performfuneral rites as if one of the members of their family  died.”  “Are there any other funnystories related to cobras?” the young wife enquired. “Yes. There are so many stories to tellbut I will tell them tomorrow. The patients may be waiting for me at hospital,” the doctorsaid and left for hospital in a hurry.I.Your teacher will tell you the story, ‘Master of the Game.’ Listen to itcarefully and answer the following questions.1.What made the old man talk to the boys?2.Why did the boys stop  playing cricket in the night outside the old man’shouse?ListeningStudy Skills"

In  hischildhood he suffered from ill health. After a long decline inhealth, he died of heart disease. His principal areas of work asan artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to illustratebirds and animals; making coloured drawings during his journeys;as an author, Lear is principally known for his popular nonsense works, rather than as atravel writer. These show a great ability to use with relish the sound of real and inventedEnglish words. The poem ‘The Duck and the Kangaroo’ is a poem with a touch of lighthumour.Glossary"

52,,True Height,"This story talks about the feelings of an athlete as he pursues his dream. Readabout a nerve-wracking day in Michael Stone’s life as he prepares to take the ultimatetest of his sports career. It is an awe-inspiring achievement that will leave you breathless.His palms were sweating. He needed a towel to dry his grip. A glass of ice waterquenched his thirst but hardly cooled his intensity. The astroturf  he sat on was as hot as thecompetition he faced today at the National Junior Olympics. The pole was set at 17 feet.That was three inches higher than his personal best. Michael Stone confronted the mostchallenging day of his pole-vaulting career. The stands were still filled with about twentythousand people, even though the final race had ended an hour earlier.The pole vault is truly the glamorous event of any track and field competition. Thesportsman combines the grace of a gymnast with the strength of a bodybuilder. Pole-vaultingalso has the element of flying, and the thought of flying as high as a two-storeyed buildingis a mere fantasy to anyone watching such an event. Today it is not only Michael Stone’sreality and dream – it is his quest.As long as Michael could remember, he had always dreamed of flying. Michael’smother read him numerous stories about flying when he was growing up. Her stories werealways the ones that described the land from a bird’s-eye view. Her excitement and passionfor details made Michael’s dreams full of colour and beauty. Michael had this one recurringdream. He would be running down a country road. He could feel the rocks and chunks ofdirt at his feet. As he raced down the golden-lined wheat fields, he would always outrun thelocomotives passing by. He would begin soaring like an eagle.Where he flew would always coincide with his mother’s stories. His dad, on the otherhand, was not a dreamer. Bert Stone was a hard-core realist. He believed in hard work andsweat. His motto: If you want something, work for it!From the age of fourteen, Michael did just that. He began a very careful and regimentedweightlifting programme. He worked out every other day with weights, with some kind ofrunning work on alternate days. The programme was carefully monitored by Michael’s coach,trainer and father. Michael’s dedication, determination and discipline was a coach’s dream."
53,,,"28   Besides being an honest student, Michael Stone continued to help his parents with theirfarm chores. Michael’s persistence in striving for perfection was not only his obsessionbut his passion.Mildred Stone, Michael’s mother, wished that he could relax a bit more and be that‘free dreaming’ little boy. On one occasion she attempted to talk to him and his father aboutthis, but his dad quickly interrupted, smiled and said, “You want something, work for it!”All of Michael’s vaults today seemed to be the reward for his hard work. If MichaelStone was surprised, thrilled or arrogant about clearing the bar at 17 feet, you couldn’t tell.As soon as he landed on the inflated landing mat, and with the crowd on its feet, Michaelimmediately began preparing for his next attempt at flight. He seemed oblivious of the factthat he had just surpassed his personal best by three inches and that he was one of the finaltwo competitors in the pole-vaulting event at the National Junior Olympics.Michael cleared the bar at 17 feet and 2 inches and 17 feet 4 inches; again he showedno emotion. Constant preparation and determination were his vision. As he lay on his backand heard the crowd groan, he knew the other vaulter had missed his final jump. He knew itwas time for his final jump. Since the other vaulter had fewer misses, Michael needed toclear this vault to win. A miss would get him second place. Nothing to be ashamed of, butMichael would not allow himself the thought of not winning first place.He rolled over and did his ritual of three finger-tipped push-ups. He found his pole,stood and stepped on the runway that led to the most challenging event of his seventeen-year-old life.The runway felt different this time. It startled him for a brief moment. Then it all hithim like a wet bale of hay. The bar was set at nine inches higher than his personal best.“That’s only one inch off the National record,” he thought. The intensity of the momentfilled his mind with anxiety. He began shaking off the tension from his body. It wasn’tworking. He became more tense. “Why is this happening to me now?” he thought. He beganto get nervous. Fear would be a more accurate description. What was he going to do? Hehad never experienced these feelings. Then out of nowhere, and from the deepest depths ofhis souls, he envisioned his mother. Why now? What was his mother doing in his thoughtsat a time like this? It was simple. His mother always used to tell him whenever he felt tense,anxious or even scared, to take deep breaths.So he did. Along with shaking the tension from legs, he gently laid his pole at his feet.He began to stretch out his arm and upper body. The light breeze that was once there wasnow gone. He could feel a trickle of cold sweat running down his back. He carefully pickedup his pole. He felt his heart pounding. He was sure the crowd did, too. The silence wasdeafening. When he heard the singing of some distant robins in flight, he knew it was histime to fly.As he began sprinting down the runway, something felt wonderfully different, yetfamiliar. The surface below him felt like the country road he used to dream about. Therocks and chunks of dirt, the visions of the golden wheat fields seemed to fill his thoughts."
54,,,"29   When he took a deep breath, it happened. He began to fly. His take-off was effortless.Michael Stone was  flying, just as in his childhood dreams. Only this time he knew hewasn’t dreaming. This was real. Everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. The airaround him was the purest and freshest he had ever sensed. Michael was soaring with themajesty of an eagle.It was either the eruption of the people in the stands or the thump of his landing thatbrought Michael back to earth. On his back with that wonderful hot sun on his face, hecould only envision the smile on his mother’s face. He knew his dad was probably smilingtoo, even laughing. Bert would always do that when he got excited, smile and then sort ofgiggle. What he didn’t know was that his dad was hugging his wife and crying. He was cryingharder than Mildred had ever seen before. She also knew he was crying the greatest tears ofall: tears of pride.Michael was immediately swarmed with people hugging and congratulating him onthe greatest accomplishment of his life. He later went on that day to clear 17 feet 6½inches – a National and International Junior Olympics record.With all the media attention and heartfelt congratulations, Michael’s life would neverbe the same. It wasn’t just because he won the National Junior Olympics and set a newworld record. And it wasn’t because he had just increased his personal best by 9½ inches. Itwas simply because. . . Michael Stone was blind.- David Naster"

The key is self-belief andperforming consistently in tough conditions,” V.V.S. Laxman tells V. V. Subrahmanyam.One of the finest players in contemporary cricket has called it a day. For someonewho delighted cricket lovers with his brilliance with the willow for 16 long years in Testcricket, Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman announced his retirement at a crowded mediaconference in Hyderabad, ahead of the two-test series against New Zealand.The 37-year-old star batsman, who was part of the fabulous batting line-up whichhelped India become the No.1 Test team, shares his experiences and thoughts in anexclusive interview with Sportstar.Sportstar: When you look back, how has the journey beenin the world of cricket?V.V.S.Laxman: It has been wonderful. I was lucky that theHyderabad Cricket Association promoted me and Zaki (SyedMoinuddin Zaki) from the under-16 level itself. They madeus play in the under-19 grade the same year. It was a hugeleap for us and very encouraging. Fortunately, by 18, I wason the verge of playing for Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy.Honestly, I feel that all the hard work andcommitment I put in from the start of my career haveculminated in 16 long years of international cricket. It hasbeen an immensely satisfying feeling to have contributed to Indian cricket in myown way.SS :Who has been the biggest influence on you?VVS:My parents (Dr. V. Shantaram and Dr. V. Satyabhama), no doubt about that. Especially,given the fact that sports was never an integral part of our family. But, the guidingphilosophy which they taught was handling success and failure with equal ease."
67,,,"39   SS :What did the sport teach you?VVS :Character. To treat success and failure on the same wavelength. It also taught me tobe very balanced and obviously whatever I am today is because of cricket.SS :What was the most difficult phase of your career?VVS :It was when I had to prefer cricket to academics. That was the toughest moment ofmy life. Though there was always the dream to play for my country, I also had anatural desire to be a doctor, coming from a family of doctors. Luckily, my fathergave me the complete freedom to choose any one of the two. Here the role of myuncle Baba Mohan was very crucial along with some of the coaches then.SS :Do you believe that it will be difficult for the modern-day young talent tomake it as big as you did? Have things changed a lot in this regard?VVS :Frankly, now-a-days it is more easy to perform and be recognised because of themedia glare. There are many platforms for real talent to come good and the IPL isone such which pushes you into national reckoning. If you perform you are boundto get recognized.SS :From where did you draw the strength to emerge as a giant every time therewas an effort to dwarf your achievements?VVS :My parents and my entire family again. They, along with my well-wishers, were always the source of inspiration. The best part isthat they never changed irrespective of whether I was performingor not.SS :What were your biggest moments as a cricketer?VVS :There were many. But some stand out. Though I never played theWorld Cup that saw India as the No.1 team, being a member ofthe Indian team which was the world No.1 in Test cricket wasone of them. The 281 against the Aussies in Kolkata in 2001 wasanother. That Test remains the most memorable match for me. Infact, that Test series was very special for all the players for itwas also the best and the most memorable series. That seriesgave us the confidence that we can be the best. Clearly, that wasthe turning point of Indian cricket itself."
68,,,"40   SS :When you look back, what were thereasons for India becoming the No. 1side?VVS :It is important to remember that it wasnot a sudden transformation which hadcome in one year. It all started in early2000 when Sourav (Ganguly) became thecaptain. I feel lucky to have played underSourav, my first captain Sachin and M.S(Dhoni). They all led by example.Everyone was a true performer and allof them had traits of leadership.SS :How different was Sourav Ganguly as a captain?VVS :I must say that the combination of Sourav and Coach John Wright was influential inchanging the mindset of Indian cricket itself. For, it was then that we started doingwell consistently, especially abroad. And we had some amazingly talented individualswith the hunger for success, who played with great pride, worked really hard andshowed great commitment levels.SS :What has been your funniest incident on the field?VVS :Well (with a big smile), when  Sourav and  I collided while taking a single in an OvalODI. It is still amusing and embarrassing, when I look back as to how it could havehappened.SS :What was the most disappointing moment for you?VVS :There was nothing like that. But, I would feel terribly disgusted whenever I droppeda catch. I would feel sorry for the bowler who puts in such a great effort and thechance is floored! That hurt me the most.SS :What are your hobbies?VVS :I love to spend time with the members of my family. It gives  so much of peace. Ido love reading biographies of successful individuals. For, they help us know howthey handled different aspects in life and in sport."

77,,Swami Is Expelled from School,"The headmaster entered the class with a slightly flushed face and a hard ominous lookin his eyes. Swaminathan wished that he had been anywhere but there at that moment. Theheadmaster surveyed the class for a few minutes and asked, ‘Are you not ashamed of comingand sitting there after what you did yesterday?’ Just as a special honour to them, he read outthe names of a dozen students or so that had attended the class. After that he read out thenames of those that had kept away, and asked them to stand on their benches. He felt thatpunishment was not enough and asked them to stand on their desks. Swaminathan was amongthem and felt humiliated at that eminence. Then they were lectured. When it was over, theywere asked to offer explanations one by one. One said that he had an attack of a  headacheand therefore could not come to school. He was asked to bring a medical certificate.The second said that while he had been coming to school on the previous day, someonehad told him that there would be no school, and he had gone back home. The headmasterreplied that if he was going to listen to every loafer who said there would be no school, hedeserved to be flogged. Anyway, why did he not come to  school and verify? No answer. Thepunishment was pronounced: ten days’ attendance cancelled, two rupees fine, and the wholeday to be spent on the desk. The third said that he had an attack of a headache. The fourthsaid that he had stomach ache. The fifth said that his grandmother died suddenly just as hewas starting for school. The headmaster asked him if he could bring a letter from his father.No. He had no father. Then, who was his guardian? His grandmother. But the grandmotherwas dead, was she not? No. It was another grandmother. The headmaster asked how manygrandmothers a person could have. No answer. Could he bring a letter from his neighbours?No, he could not. None of his neighbours could read or write, because he lived in a veryilliterate part of Ellaman Street. Then the headmaster offered to send a teacher to thisilliterate locality to ascertain from the boy’s neighbours if the death of the grandmotherwas a fact. A pause, some perspiration, and then the answer that the neighbours could notpossibly know anything about it, since the grandmother died in the village. The headmasterhit him on the knuckles with his cane, called him a street dog, and pronounced the punishment:fifteen days suspension.When Swaminathan’s turn came, he looked around helplessly. Rajam sat on the thirdbench in front, and resolutely looked away. He was gazing at the blackboard intently."
78,,,"48   Yet the back of his head and the pink ears were visible to Swaminathan. It was anintolerable sight. Swaminathan was in acute suspense lest that head should turn and fix itseyes on his; he felt that he would drop from the desk to the floor, if that happened. The pinkears three benches off made him incapable of speech. If only somebody would put ablackboard between his eyes and those pink ears!He was deaf to the question that the headmaster was putting to him. A rap on his bodyfrom the headmaster’s cane brought him to himself.‘Why did you keep away yesterday?’ asked the headmaster, looking up. Swaminathan’sfirst impulse was to protest that he had never been absent. But the attendance register wasthere. ‘No-no-I was stoned. I tried to come, but they took away my cap and burnt it. Manystrong men held me down when I tried to come.... When a great man is sent to gaol .... I amsurprised to see you a slave of the Englishmen.... Didn’t they cut off—Dacca Muslin—Slaves of slaves ....’ These were some of the disjointed explanations which streamed intohis head, and, which, even at that moment, he was discreet enough not to express. He hadwanted to mention a headache, but he found to his distress that others beside him had one.The headmaster shouted, ‘Won’t you open your mouth?’ He brought the cane sharply downon Swaminathan’s right shoulder. Swaminathan kept staring at the headmaster with tearfuleyes, massaging with his left hand the spot where the cane was laid. ‘I will kill you if youkeep on staring without answering my question,’ cried the headmaster."
79,,,"49   ‘I….I….couldn’t come,’ stammered Swaminathan.‘Is that so?’ asked the headmaster, and turning to a boy said, ‘Bring the peon.’Swaminathan thought: ‘What, is he going to ask the peon to thrash me? If he does anysuch thing, I will bite everybody dead.’ The peon came. The headmaster said to him, ‘Nowsay what you know about this rascal on the desk.’The peon eyed Swaminathan with a sinister look, grunted, and demanded, ‘Didn’t I seeyou break the panes? . . .’‘Of the ventilators in my room?’ added the  headmaster with zest.Here there was no chance of escape. Swaminathan kept staring foolishly till he receivedanother whack on the back. The headmaster demanded what the young brigand had to sayabout it. The brigand had nothing to say. It was a fact that he had broken the panes. They hadseen it. There was nothing more to it. He had unconsciously become defiant and did notcare to deny the charge. When another whack came on his back, he ejaculated, ‘Don’t beatme, sir. It pains.’ This was an invitation to the headmaster to bring down the cane four timesagain. He said, ‘Keep standing here, on this desk, staring like an idiot, till I announce yourdismissal.’Every pore in Swaminathan’s body burnt with the touch of the cane. He had a suddenflood of courage, the courage that comes of desperation. He restrained the tears that werethreatening to rush out, jumped down, and grasping his books, rushed out muttering,‘I don’t care for your dirty school.’- R. K. Narayan"

91,,,"60   Homework has historically been given to students to reinforce what they learn atschool, and ultimately to help them learn the material better. However, too much homeworkis not helpful, and can be counter-productive. Excessive amounts of time spent oncompleting homework can take away  the kid’s social life, family time, and it limits theirparticipation in sports or other activities. The amount of homework a teacher has to  give toa student should be restricted.Critically acclaimed author, Tamim Ansary reports that since 1981, the amount ofhomework given to an average sixth class child has increased by more than fifty per cent.Many people claim that the increase in homework dates as far back as 1957. The newcompetition that emerged served as an incentive for schools to try to increase the volumeof the curriculum. The amount of homework increases with the increase in class.Many teachers defend largeamounts of homework, claiming that ithelps to prepare students for a world thatis becoming increasingly competitive.However, Dr. Kralovec, author of ‘TheEnd of Homework’,  argues that doinghomework during high school has littleor no effect on successful study skillsof  the students when they join  college.Excessive amounts of homeworkcan be harmful to kids both physicallyand mentally. A lot of homework usuallymeans a lot of books to carry. Fifty-fivepercent of the Massachusetts ( aninstitution in the  U.S.A.) children,  asper the survey by researchers ofSimmons College,  carry loads heavierthan fifteen percent of their body weight,"
92,,,"61   which is the suggestedlimit. Carrying largeamounts of weight daily ata young age can do a lotof damage because bonesare still in developmentstage. The U.S. ConsumerProduct SafetyCommission has reportedthat in 1999, more than800 kids were treated inemergency wards forbackpack-related injuries.Many of these injuries can lead to serious problems later in life including chronic shoulder,neck, and back pain.The large amount of homework is causing kids in both high school and junior highschool to be up until midnight or later. When extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs,etc are added to the picture, kids may even have to wake up early next morning to finishtheir homework, leaving them with an insufficient amount of sleep. Some parents and teachersargue that it would be beneficial to a child’s academics to limit after school activities.However, cutting the time out of  the few hours a week teenagers use for exercise,  couldbe a factor in the growing obesity cases.The number of children who are overweight has doubled in the last two to three decades;currently one child out of  five is overweight. These children are faced with  more problemsin school. Instead of learning and concentrating on their work, many children are  developinglow self-esteem and even depression because of teasing. The cases of obesity are growingmost certainly due to  lack of physical exercise. With more and more homework beingassigned, kids simply do not have enough time for  proper amount of exercise.Homework also takes away the time that a kid could be spending with his or herfamily. Rather than spending time bonding and building strong family relationships, parentsand children argue over homework. Time is taken away from important aspects of dailylife. This time is particularly precious in families with both the parents working. The timespent by such  parents  with their children is  very limited. This time could be better spentgoing out to dinner as a family, or doing other activities that most families are not able todo because the kids don’t have time to take a break from their homework schedule.When assignments are given carelessly and frequently, it causes students to loseinterest in the subject. Negative results can also occur when a student is not able to complete"
93,,,"62   his or her homework. Many times they will resort to copying the homework, having othersdo their assignments, or cheating in tests. Bad habits such as these are likely to haunt kidsthrough their lives and have an adverse effect on their moral judgement. Students will,almost always take the easy way, when it comes to homework.The use of homework is effective when used by the rule “less is more”. Overwhelmingkids with loads of homework can cause them stress and possible physical injury. Homeworktakes away from the small amount of time kids get to spend with their parents and siblings.A limit on their physical and social activities can also take a large toil on their lives, andcould hinder their health and future relationships.This is not to say that homework should  be abolished, but it should be limited.

The idea is strange to us. Ifwe do not own the freshness of  air and the sparkle of  water, how can you buy them fromus?”Every part of the Earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandyshore, every mist in the dark woods, every clear and humming insect are holy in the memoryand experience of my people. The sap which courses through the trees carries the memoryand experience of my people. The sap, which courses through the trees, carries the memoriesof the red man."
100,,What Is Man Without the Beasts?,
101,,,"68   .We are a part of the Earth and it is a part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters;the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices inthe meadows, the body heat of the pony, and the man, all belong to the same family.  So,when the Great Chief in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land, he asksmuch of us. The Great White Chief sends word, that he will reserve us a place so that wecan live comfortably to ourselves. He will be our father and we will be his children. So wewill consider your offer to buy land. But it will not be easy. For, this land is sacred to us.This shining water that moves in streams and rivers is not just water but the blood ofour ancestors. If we sell you land, you must remember that it is the sacred blood of ourancestors. If we sell you land, you must remember that it is sacred, and you must teach yourchildren that it is sacred and that each ghostly reflection in the clear water of the lakes tellsof events in the life of my people. The water’s murmur is the voice of my father's father.The rivers of our brothers quench our thirst. The rivers carry our canoes and feed ourchildren. If we sell you our land, you must remember to teach your children that the riversare our brothers, and yours, and you must henceforth give the rivers the kindness that youwould give my brother."
102,,,"69   PreciousThe air is precious to the red man, for all things share the same breath - the beast, thetree, the man - they all share the same breath. The white man does not seem to notice the airhe breathes. Like a man dying for many days, he is numb to the stench. But if we sell youour land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit withall the life it supports. The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also receives hislast sigh. And if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place whereeven the white man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers.So we will consider your offer to buy our land. If we decide to accept, I will make onecondition - the white man must treat the beasts of this land as his brothers.I am a savage and do not understand any other way. I have seen thousands of rottingbuffaloes on the prairie, left by the white man who shot them from a passing train. I am asavage and do not understand how the smoking iron horse can be made more important thanthe buffalo that you kill only to stay alive.What is man without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from agreat loneliness of the spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. Allthings are connected.RespectYou must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of ourgrandfathers.  So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the Earth is rich withthe lives of our kin. Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the Earth isour mother. Whatever befalls the Earth befalls the sons of the Earth. If men spit upon theground, they spit upon themselves.This we know - the Earth does not belong to man - man belongs to the Earth.  Allthings are connected like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected.Whatever befalls the Earth - befalls the sons of the Earth. Man did not weave the webof life - he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself."

In 1854, Chief Seattle reluctantlyagreed to sell tribal lands to the United States Government and to move to Governmentestablished reservations.

You maythink now that you own Him as you wish to own our land, but you cannot. He is the God ofman, and His compassion is equal for the red man and the white. The Earth is precious toHim, and to harm the Earth is to heap contempt on its Creator. The whites too shall pass,perhaps sooner than all other tribes.But in your perishing you will shine brightly, fired by the strength of the God whobrought you to this land and for some special purpose gave you dominion over this land andover the red man. The destiny is a mystery to us, for we do not understand when the buffalosare slaughtered, the wild horses tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with the scentof many men, and the view of the ripe hills blotted by talking wires.

Obviously, not. The speech containslong sentences (But in your ... over the red man), short ones ( Where is the thicket?)and even fragments (Gone). Why do writers vary the length of the sentences? Again,why do they use different types of structures (sometimes statements, questions,exclamations, fragments, etc.)?Good writers vary their sentences to make them interesting.Sentence length can influence the mood of the piece. If you’re concernedthat your writing is either too choppy or too flowery, review it with an eye on thesentence length.Is it varied?Does it fit the mood you’re trying to convey?Do you heavily favour short, simple sentences, or does the piece contain too manyparagraph-long sentences?To make your texts more interesting, you should use sentences of varying lengthswith a variety of structures.Read the following text.Dogs are our great companions, aren’t they?  Any idea when the friendshipbetween man and dogs began? Maybe, thousands of years back. Who knows! Whatis important is that they are man’s best friends for obvious reasons. Dogs, as such,need to be walked. Walks keep their owners healthy; and the owners can talk totheir dogs. They never tell secrets.

A simile, on the other hand, is indirect and usually only likened to be similar tosomething else. Similes usually use “like” or “as” (e.g. “Your eyes are like the ocean”)."

The old house built with solid blocks of  granitewasn’t altered at all. But there was a new outhouse, and there were fewer trees. He was gladto see that the jackfruit tree still stood at the side of the building casting its shade on thewall. He remembered his grandmother saying: ‘A blessing rests on the house where theshadow of  a tree falls.’ And so the present owners must also be receiving the tree’s blessings.At the spot where he stood there had once been a turnstile, and as a boy he would swing onit, going round and round until he was quite dizzy. Now the turnstile had gone, the openingwalled up. Tall hollyhocks grew on the other side of the wall.‘What are you looking at?’It was a disembodied voice at first. Moments later a girl stood framed between darkred hollyhocks staring at the man. She was only twelve or thirteen, slim and dark, withlively eyes and long black hair.‘I’m looking at the house,’ he said."

They stood on either side of  the wall,appraising each other.‘Well,’ she said finally. ‘If  you don’t want to buy the house, what are you looking at?’‘I used to live here once.’‘Oh!’‘Twenty-five years ago. As a boy. As a young man.... And then my grandmother died,and we sold the house and went away.’She was silent for a while, taking in this information. Then she said, ‘And you’d like tobuy it back now, but you don’t have the money?’ He did not look very prosperous.‘No, I wasn’t thinking of  buying it back, wanted to see it again, that’s all. How longhave you lived in it?’‘Only three years,’ she smiled. She’d been eating a melon, and there was still juice inthe corners of her mouth.‘Would you like to come in and look more closely?’‘Wouldn’t your parents mind?’‘They’ve gone to the club.’ They won’t mind. I’m allowed to bring my friends home.’‘Even elderly friends like me?’‘How old are you?’‘Oh, just middle aged, but feeling young today.’ And to prove it he decided he’d climbover the wall instead of going round to the gate. He got up on the wall all right, but had torest there, breathing heavily.‘Middle-aged man on the flying trapeze,’ he muttered to himself.‘I’ll help you,’ she said, and gave him her hand.He slithered down into a flower-bed, shattering the stem of a hollyhock.As they walked across the grass he spotted a stone bench under a mango tree.

It was March, and the mango tree was in blossom. Asweet, rather heavy fragrance drenched the garden.They were silent for some time. The man closed his eyes and remembered othertimes - the music of a piano, the chiming of  a grandfather clock, the constant twitter ofbudgerigars on the veranda, his grandfather’s cranking up the old car....‘I used to climb the jackfruit tree,’ he said, opening his eyes. ‘I didn’t like the jackfruit,though. Do you?’‘It’s all right in pickles.’‘I suppose so…. The tree was easy to climb; I spent a lot of  time in it.’‘Do you want to climb it again? My parents won’t mind.’‘No, no. Not after climbing the garden wall. Let’s just sit here for a few minutes andtalk. I mention the jackfruit tree because it was my favourite place. Do you see that thickbranch stretching out over the roof ? Half  way along it there’s a small hollow in which Iused to keep some of  my treasures.’‘What kind of treasures?’‘Oh, nothing very valuable. Marbles I’d won. A book I wasn’t supposed to read. A fewold coins I’d collected. Things came and went. I was a bit of a crow, you know, collectingbright things and putting them away. There was my grandfather’s Iron Cross. Well, not mygrandfather’s exactly, because he was British and the Iron Cross’ was a German decorationawarded for bravery during the War - the first World War - when my grandfather fought inFrance. He got it from a German soldier.’‘Dead or alive?’‘I beg your pardon? Oh, you mean the German. I never asked. Dead, I suppose. Orperhaps he was a prisoner. I never asked Grandfather. Isn’t that strange?’‘And the Iron Cross? Do you still have it?’‘No’, he said, looking her in the eyes. ‘I left it in the jackfruit tree.’‘You left it in the tree?’‘Yes, I was so excited at the time, packing and saying goodbye to people and thinkingabout the ship I was going to sail on that I simply forgot all about it.’She was silent, considering, her finger on her lips, her gaze fixed on the jackfruit tree.Then, quietly, she said, ‘It may still be there. In the hollow in the branch.’‘Yes’, he said. ‘It’s twenty-five years, but it may still be there. Unless someone elsefound it….’‘Would you like to go and look?’‘I can’t climb trees any more.’"

Soon she was in thejackfruit tree, crawling along the projecting branch. A warm wind brought little eddies ofdust along the road. Summer was in the air....‘I’ve found it!’ she cried. ‘I’ve found something!’And now, barefoot, she ran breathlessly towards him, in her outstretched hand a rustyold medal.He took it from her and turned it over on his palm.‘Is it the Iron Cross?’ she asked eagerly.‘Yes’, he said, ‘this is it.’‘Now I know why you came. You wanted to see if  it was still in the tree.’‘You may be right. I’m not really sure why I came. But you can keep the Cross. Youfound it, after all.’‘No, you keep it. It’s yours.’‘But it could have remained in the tree for another twenty-five years if you hadn’tclimbed up to look for it.’‘But if you hadn’t come back again....’‘On the right day, at the right time, and with the right person’, he said, getting up andplacing the medal in her hands. ‘It wasn’t the Cross I came for.

By the noon of the daypeople bore the brunt of the flood fury as the flood water reached the first storey of severalbuildings. The Srisailam right bank power house submerged. There were heart-rending scenesof people frantically seeking assistance to rescue them. The people had never experiencedbefore, such a trauma and loss of property.But the government did not have sufficient number of boats and men to help them.The authorities estimated that about 40,000 people had taken shelter on the roof-tops.The floods inundated about 60 villages all over the district. Many of them completelysubmerged. Much of the misery was caused by the Tungabhadra and the Handri Niva rivers,tributaries of the Krishna. Several places, including Mantralayam, the seat of Sri RaghavendraSwamy Mutt, were under  a sheet of ten feet of water for four days.The government was forced to seek the help of the army and the navy. One of the IAF(Indian Air Force) helicopters, requisitioned by the government, rescued 15 farmers trappedin a swollen stream in a daring operation. The Sunkesula barrage across the Tungabhadrabreached at two places as it could not discharge the massive flood.Thirty relief camps were opened in Kurnool to provide food and shelter to at least25,000 people rendered homeless. Many people lost everything they had. Apart from seekingthe help of the army and the navy, the government requisitioned the personnel of the Disaster"

Heart-rendingsights welcomed themwhen they were backhome after the floodcatastrophe. Poor cattle--  cows and calves,buffalos and bullocksand other domestic animals, unaware of  what was to come, had to die as they were fastenedin their sheds. The grief-struck people stood aghast at their paddy fields, which were aboutto be reaped, engulfed by the massive floods.The government officials and voluntary organizations that arrived at the spot witnessedthe badly damaged roads, railways and collapsed bridges.The government  sent relief teams as early as possible to distribute the emergencyrelief supplies like food, drinking water and clothing   among the flood survivors. Therelief teams reached some of the worst-hit areas and found that the people had lost theirwhole lives, their memories, homes and loved ones. Thousands of people were misplacedfrom their homes. All of them were in need of food and drinking water. They were lookingon with wide open eyes for some help to meet their needs. No sooner had the relief teamsarrived there than their joy knew no bounds.  A sigh of relief rejuvenated their faces. Thepeople were given food, bed sheets, lungis (wraparound skirts worn by men or women) andtowels. Some of them were half-naked. No sooner had they received the clothes than theyexpressed their gratitude with the pulled down faces of two sleepless nights.One of the sufferers of the flood was a widow of well past 40.

136,,,"99   The word “disaster” is derived from Middle French “desastre” and from old Latin“disastro”. A disaster can be defined as any tragic event that can cause damage to life, propertyand destroy the economic, social and cultural life.The natural disaster is a consequence when a natural hazard affects humans or builtenvironment. Human vulnerability and lack of appropriate emergency management lead tofinancial, environmental and human loss. The resulting loss depends on the capacity of thepopulation to support or resist the disaster. Disasters occur when hazards  meet vulnerability.A natural hazard will never result in a natural disaster in areas without vulnerability.Various phenomena like earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods andcyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy a lot of money andproperty each year.Natural hazards can strike in unpopulated areas and never develop into disasters.The rapid growth of the world’s population and its increased concentration often in hazardousenvironments has escalated both the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Tropicalclimate, unstable land forms, deforestation and non-engineered constructions make thedisaster–prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronicallyby natural disasters.Listen to the “News Bulletin” read by your teacher and answer the following questions.1.What was  the havoc caused by the flood?2.What relief measures were taken by the Government of A.P.?3.What are the other  highlights of the news bulletin?

140,,,"102   The world is not a very safe place to live in these days as disaster and terrorism canstrike at any moment. Communication is the only relief in times of disaster and hence theneed for an efficient disaster management system becomes imperative in public places andeven in business establishments and important commercial joints where people move aroundin large numbers. Disaster might strike in the form of natural calamities, terrorist attacksand accidents. Thus an efficient disaster management system which will work in adverseconditions is needed.Disaster management crew must be well trained and equipped with the best applianceswhich might help them to communicate the condition they are in and the status of thecalamity in the region they work for. In times of natural calamity like floods, storms or firethe usual mode of communication like phone, mobile etc might not work or might becomeinoperative in the calamity. Underground communication lines get disabled due to flooding,cell towers are blown over or simply choke due to high utilization, backup generators runout of fuel, or are filled up with water. This is where Ham Radio (Amateur Radio) comesinto picture. Using HF (High Frequency) radio sets, messages can be conveyed or relayedto long distance. Accurate picture of situation on the ground, requirements and keyinformation could be sent to disaster response team.With Amateur Radio Operators, you have a ready workforce that is efficient withregard to communicating with each other ‘efficiently’ and ‘effectively’. They are knownfor innovation and are adept at adapting to situations. Unlike commercial systems, Amateurradio is not  dependent on terrestrial facilities that can fail. It is dispersed throughout acommunity without “choke points” such as cellular telephone sites that can be overloaded.Amateur Radio Operators are experienced in improvising antennas and power sourcesand most equipment available  today can be powered by an automobile battery.  Annual“Field Days” are held in many countries to practise these emergency improvisational skills.Amateur Radio Operators volunteer to  help, as and when needed; however, there is nonational database on active operators who can be called upon during any disaster, and also ifthey have right setup (which means – ready to go on air gear) at short notice. AmateurRadio Operators can use hundreds of frequencies and can quickly establish networks tyingdisparate agencies together to enhance interoperability."

With the help of Hams fromvarious parts of the country, anemergency traffic network wasestablished to exchange informationto various parts of the country.Recent examples include theSeptember 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in Manhattan in 2001, the 2003 NorthAmerica blackout and Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, where Amateur radio wasused to coordinate disaster relief activities when other systems failed.On September 2, 2004, Ham radio was used to inform weather forecasters withinformation on Hurricane Frances live from the Bahamas. On December 26, 2004, anearthquake and resulting Tsunami across the Indian Ocean wiped out all communicationswith the Andaman Islands, except for an expedition that provided a means to coordinaterelief efforts. Recently,  Amateur Radio Operators in the People’s Republic of China providedemergency communications after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and U.S. hams did similarwork following Hurricane Ike.But cyclones, earthquakes or floods are not everyday events. What we see every dayis that someone in the remote place is struggling for life, awaiting the arrival of an essentialdrug from another town or someone has lost a dear one because medical attention couldnot reach him on time. All this happens because most often communication is slow orimpossible. Hams have special section to handle medical and other emergency traffic ontheir daily nets.How to Become a Radio Amateur?Amateur Radio Operators have to qualify in an examination conducted by Ministryof Communications, Government of India and obtain license for operating / possessing aRadio Station.

148,,Freedom,Look at the following pictures and discuss the questions that follow.
149,,,"109   In life, every man has twin obligations — obligations to his family, to his parents, tohis wife and children; and he has an obligation to his people, his community and  his country.In a civil and humane society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations according to hisown inclinations and abilities. But in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossiblefor a man of my birth and colour to fulfil both of those obligations. In South Africa, a manof colour who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa,a man who tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and hishome and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I didnot in the beginning choose toplace my people above myfamily, but in attempting toserve my people, I found that Iwas prevented from fulfillingmy obligations as a son, abrother, a father and a husband.I was not born with ahunger to be free. I was bornfree — free in every way that Icould know. Free to run in thefields near my mother’s hut,free to swim in the clearstream that ran through myvillage, free to roast mealiesunder the stars and ride thebroad backs of slow-movingbulls. As long as I obeyed myfather and abided by thecustoms of my tribe, I was nottroubled by the laws of man orGod."
150,,A Long Walk to Freedom,
151,,,"110   It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when Idiscovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began tohunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedomsof being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as a youngman in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honourable freedoms of achieving mypotential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family — the freedom not to beobstructed in a lawful life.But then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were notfree. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyonewho looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is whenthe hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people.It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self-respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, thatdrove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband intoa man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no morevirtuous or self-sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy thepoor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free. Freedom isindivisible; the chains on anyone of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains onall of my people were the chains on me.I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man whotakes away another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is locked behind the bars ofprejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else’sfreedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressedand the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.- Nelson MandelaNelson Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, was the first South African President to beelected in a fully representative democratic election. Trained as an attorney, he helpedform the Youth League of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944. In 1961 heabandoned peaceful protest and became head of the ANC’s new military wing. Sentencedto life imprisonment in 1964, Mandela came to symbolize black political aspirations andwas named head of the ANC after his release on Feb. 11, 1990. He and F.

162,,An Icon of Civil Rights,"Martin Luther King's Acceptance Speech, on the occasion of the award of theNobel Peace Prize in Oslo, December 10, 1964.Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies andGentlemen:          I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at amoment when 22 million Negroes of theUnited States of America are engaged in acreative battle to end the long night of racialinjustice. I accept this award on behalf of acivil rights movement which is moving withdetermination and a majestic scorn for riskand danger to establish a reign of freedom anda rule of justice. I am mindful that onlyyesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, ourchildren, crying out for brotherhood, wereanswered with fire hoses, snarling dogs andeven death. I am mindful that only yesterdayin Philadelphia, Mississippi, young peopleseeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday morethan 40 houses of worship in the state of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned becausethey offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful thatdebilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung ofthe economic ladder.         Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleagueredand committed to unrelenting struggle; to a movement which has not won the very peaceand brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize.After contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of thatmovement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political"
163,,,"120   and moral question of our time - the need for man to overcome oppression and violencewithout resorting to violence and oppression. Civilization and violence are antitheticalconcepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstratedthat nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for socialtransformation. Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way tolive together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creativepsalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict amethod which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a methodis love. The tortuous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama to Oslo bears witnessto this truth. This is a road over which millions of Negroes are travelling to find a newsense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress andhope. It has led to a new Civil Rights Bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened andlengthened into a super highway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numberscreate alliances to overcome their common problems.I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith inthe future of mankind. I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities ofhistory. I refuse to accept the idea that the ""isness"" of man's present nature makes himmorally incapable of reaching up for the eternal ""oughtness"" that forever confronts him. Irefuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, unable toinfluence the unfolding events which surround him. I refuse to accept the view that mankindis so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak ofpeace and brotherhood can never become a reality.I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down amilitaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truthand unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why ‘right’ temporarilydefeated is stronger than evil triumphant. I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts andwhining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice,lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can be lifted from this dust ofshame to reign supreme among the children of men. I have the audacity to believe thatpeoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture fortheir minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered men have torn down, men other-centered can build up. I still believe that one day"
164,,,"121   mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war andbloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive good will proclaim the rule of the land. ""And the lionand the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine and fig treeand none shall be afraid."" I still believe that We Shall overcome!This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give ourtired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. Whenour days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than athousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuinecivilization struggling to be born.Today I come to Oslo as a trustee, inspired and with renewed dedication to humanity.I accept this prize on behalf of all men who love peace and brotherhood. I say I come as atrustee, for in the depths of my heart I am aware that this prize is much more than an honorto me personally.Every time I take a flight, I am always mindful of the many people who make asuccessful journey possible - the known pilots and the unknown ground crew.So you honour the dedicated pilots of our struggle who have sat at the controls asthe freedom movement soared into orbit. You honor, once again, Chief Lutuli of SouthAfrica, whose struggles with and for his people, are still met with the most brutal expressionof man's inhumanity to man. You honor the ground crew without whose labour and sacrificesthe jet flights to freedom, could never have left the earth. Most of these people will nevermake the headline and their names will not appear in Who's Who. Yet when years haverolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvelous age in which welive - men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land, abetter people, a more noble civilization - because these humble children of God were willingto suffer for righteousness' sake.I think Alfred Nobel would know what I mean when I say that I accept this award inthe spirit of a curator of some precious heirloom which he holds in trust for its true owners- all those to whom beauty is truth and truth beauty - and in whose eyes the beauty ofgenuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.- Martin Luther King Jr."

This Frenchnational heroine took to the field of battle during the Hundred Years’ War (1337 -1453).At the time, the desperate French army had suffered a number of losses to the English,but Joan brought renewed confidence by lifting the siege of Orleans in nine days andtaking back the city of Reims. She was soon captured by the English.Joan of Arc, who had been caught by the British in the war, was imprisoned andpresented before  the court.Introduction of the characters :1.Inquisitor: Brother John Lemuiter, a seemingly mild , elderly man2.Canon John D’Estivet: The chief Prosecutor3.Canon de Courcelles : The Canon of Paris.

It isa fine sunshiny May morning.The Inquisitor: Let the accused be brought in.Ladvenu: [calling] The accused. Let her be brought in.Joan, chained by the ankles, is brought in through the archeddoor behind the prisoner's stool by a guard of English soldiers.With them is the Executioner and his assistants. They lead herto the prisoner's stool, and place themselves behind it aftertaking off her chain. She wears a page's black suit.The Inquisitor: [kindly] Sit down, Joan.

The English thought you weretrying to poison me--Cauchon andThe Chaplain: [together] What! No, my lord.Joan: [continuing] They are determinedthat I shall be burnt as a witch; and they sent their doctor to cureme; but he was forbidden to bleed me because the silly peoplebelieve that a witch's witchery leaves her if she is bled; so he onlycalled me filthy names. Why do you leave me in the hands of theEnglish? I should be in the hands of the Church. And why must I bechained by the feet to a log of wood? Are you afraid I will flyaway?D'Estivet: [harshly] Woman,  it is not for you to question the court; it is forus to question you.Courcelles: When you were left unchained, did you not try to escape by jumpingfrom a tower sixty feet high? If you cannot fly like a witch, how isit that you are still alive?Joan: I suppose because the tower was not so high then. It has grownhigher every day since you began asking me questions about it.D'Estivet: Why did you jump from the tower?Joan: How do you know that I jumped?D'Estivet: You were found lying in the moat. Why did you leave the tower?Joan: Why would anybody leave a prison if they could get out?D'Estivet: You tried to escape?Joan: Of course I did; and not for the first time either. If you leave thedoor of the cage open, the bird will fly out.D'Estivet: [rising] That is a confession of heresy. I call the attention of thecourt to it.Joan: Heresy, he calls it!

I have said again and again that I willtell you all that concerns this trial. But I cannot tell you the wholetruth: God does not allow the whole truth to be told. You do notunderstand it when I tell it. It is an old saying that he who tells toomuch truth is sure to be hanged. I am weary of this argument: wehave been over it nine times already. I have sworn as much as Iwill swear; and I will swear no more.Courcelles: My lord, she should be put to the torture.The Inquisitor: You hear, Joan? That is what happens to the obdurate. Think beforeyou answer. Has she been shewn the instruments?The Executioner: They are ready, my lord. She has seen them.Joan: If you tear me limb from limb until you separate my soul from mybody you will get nothing out of me beyond what I have told you.What more is there to tell that you could understand? Besides, Icannot bear to be hurt; and if you hurt me, I will say anything youlike to stop the pain. But I will take it all back afterwards; so whatis the use of it?Ladvenu: There is much in that.

It is customary.It is always done.The Inquisitor: That is not so, Master, except when the inquiries are carried on bypeople who do not know their legal business.Courcelles: But the woman is a heretic. I assure you it is always done.Cauchon: [decisively] It will not be done today if it is not necessary. Letthere be an end of this. I will not have it said that we proceeded onforced confessions. We have sent our best preachers and doctorsto this woman to exhort and implore her to save her soul and bodyfrom the fire: we shall not now send the executioner to thrust herinto it.Courcelles: Your lordship is merciful, of course. But it is a great responsibilityto depart from the usual practice.Joan: Thou are a rare noodle, Master.

I am no shepherd lass, though I have helped with the sheeplike anyone else. I will do a lady's work in the house--spin or weave--against any woman in Rouen.The Inquisitor: This is not a time for vanity, Joan. You stand in great peril.Joan: I know it.

He waskilled in a conspiracy led by Brutus. Antony, a great friend of Julius Caesar gave a rousingspeech to the public on this occasion keeping the dead body before the public.He begins his speech by saying: “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me yourears...”Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;"

197,,,"149   They say that the world today is a small place because travel has become easy, but noteverybody finds it easy to travel. Here, the author reflects humorously his experienceas a traveller.Of all the things I am not very good at, living in the real world is perhaps the mostoutstanding. I am constantly filled with wonder at the number of things that other people dowithout any evident difficulty that are pretty much beyond me.  I cannot tell you the numberof times that I have gone looking for the lavatory in a cinema, for instance, and ended upstanding in an alley on the wrong side of a self locking door.  My particular speciality nowis returning to hotel desks two or three times a day and asking what my room number is, Iam, in short, easily confused.I was thinking about this the last time we went en famille on a big trip. It was at Easter,and we were flying to England for a week. When we arrived at Logan Airport in Boston andwere checking in, I suddenly remembered that I had recently joined British Airways’ frequentflyer programme.  I also remembered that I had put the card in my carry-on bag. And here’swhere the trouble started."
198,,The Accidental Tourist,
199,,,"150   The zip on the bag was jammed.  So I pulled on it and yanked at it, with grunts andfrowns and increasing consternation. I kept this up for some minutes but it wouldn’t budge,so I pulled harder and harder, with more grunts.  Well, you can guess what happened.  Abruptlythe zip gave way.  The side of the bag flew open and everything within – newspaper cuttingsand other loose papers, a 14-ounce tin of pipe tobacco, magazines, passport, English money,film – was extravagantly ejected over an area about the size of a tennis court.I watched dumbstruck as a hundred carefully sorted documents came raining down ina fluttery cascade, coins bounced to a variety of noisy oblivions and the now-lidless tin oftobacco rolled crazily across the concourse disgorging its contents as it went.“My tobacco!” I cried in horror, thinking what I would have to pay for that muchtobacco in England now that another Budget had come and gone, and then changed the cryto “My finger! My finger!” as I discovered that I had gashed my finger on the zip and wasshedding blood in a lavish manner.  (I am not very good around flowing blood generally, butwhen it’s my own – well, I think hysterics are fully justified). Confused and unable to help,my hair went into panic mode.It was at this point that my wife looked at me with an expression of wonder – notanger or exasperation, but just simple wonder – and said, “I can’t believe you do this for aliving.”But I’m afraid it’s so. I always have catastrophes when I travel. Once on an aeroplane,I leaned over to tie a shoelace just at the moment someone in the seat ahead of me threw hisseat back into full recline, and found myself pinned helplessly in the crash position.  It wasonly by clawing the leg of the man sitting next to me that I managed to get myself freed.On another occasion, I knocked a soft drink onto the lap of a sweet little lady sittingbeside me. The flight attendant came and cleaned her up, and brought me a replacementdrink, and instantly I knocked it onto the woman again.  To this day, I don’t know how I didit.  I just remember reachingout for the new drink andwatching helplessly as myarm, like some cheap propin one of those 1950shorror movies with a namelike ‘The Undead Limb’,violently swept the drinkfrom its perch and onto herlap.The lady looked at mewith the stupefiedexpression you wouldexpect to receive fromsomeone whom you have"
200,,,"151   repeatedly drenched, and uttered an oath that started with “Oh”, finished with “sake” and inbetween had some words that I have never heard uttered in public before, certainly not by anun.This, however, was not my worst experience on a plane flight.  My worst experiencewas when I was writing important thoughts in a notebook (‘buy socks’, ‘clutch drinkscarefully’, etc.), sucking thoughtfully on the end of my pen as you do, and fell intoconversation with an attractive young lady in the next seat.  I amused her for perhaps 20minutes with a scattering of urbane bons mots, then retired to the lavatory where I discoveredthat the pen had leaked and that my mouth, chin, tongue, teeth and gums were now a striking,scrub-resistant navy blue, and would remain so for several days.So you will understand, I trust, when I tell you how much I ache to be suave. I wouldlove, just once in my life, to rise from a dinner table without looking as if I have justexperienced an extremely localised seismic event, get in a car and close the door withoutleaving 14 inches of coat outside, wear light-coloured trousers without discovering at theend of the day that I have at various times sat on chewing gum, ice cream, cough syrup andmotor oil.  But it is not to be.Now on planes when the food is delivered, my wife says: “Take the lids off the foodfor Daddy” or “Put your hoods up, children. Daddy’s about to cut his meat.”  Of course, thisis only when I am flying with my family.  When I am on my own, I don’t eat, drink or leanover to tie my shoelaces, and never put a pen anywhere near my mouth. I just sit very, veryquietly, sometimes on my hands to keep them from flying out unexpectedly and causingliquid mischief.  It’s not much fun, but it does at least cut down on the laundry bills.I never did get my frequent flyer miles, by the way. I never do. I couldn’t find the cardin time. This has become a real frustration for me.  Everyone I know – everyone – is foreverflying off to Bali first class with their air miles. I never get to collect anything. I must fly100,000 miles a year, yet I have accumulated only about 212 air miles divided betweentwenty-three airlines.This is because either I forget to ask for the air miles when I check in, or I rememberto ask for them but the air line then manages not to record them, or the check-in clerkinforms me that I am not entitled to them.  In January, on a flight to Australia – a flight forwhich I was going to get about a million air miles – the clerk shook her head when I presentedmy card and told me I was not entitled to any.“Why?”“The ticket is in the name of B. Bryson and the card is in the name of W. Bryson.”I explained to her the close and venerable relationship between Bill and William, butshe wouldn’t have it.So I didn’t get my air miles, and I won’t be flying to Bali first class just yet.  Perhapsjust as well, really, I could never go that long without eating.- Bill Bryson"

The policeman is notconvinced that they are ‘the Hindus’ (only the Hindus are allowed to enter the temple). Afight breaks out between two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps onto a shivalinga,then runs screaming around the temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati that flowsbelow. A corpse is being cremated on its banks; washerwomen are at their work and childrenbathe. From a balcony a basket of flowers and leaves, old offerings now wilted, is droppedinto the river. A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the river bank.When it emerges fully, the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period of the Kaliyugwill end on earth.At the Boudhanath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of Kathmandu, there is, in contrast, asense of stillness.

Film songsblare out from the radios, car horns sound, bicycle bells ring, stray cows low questioninglyat motorcycles, vendors shout out their wares. I indulge myself mindlessly; buy a bar ofmarzipan, a corn-on-the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier on the pavement (rubbed withsalt, chilli powder and lemon); a couple of love story comics, and even a Reader’s Digest.All this I wash down with Coca Cola and a nauseating orange drink, and feel much the betterfor it.I consider what route I should take back home. If I were propelled by enthusiasmfor travel per se, I would go by bus and train to Patna, then sail up the Ganges past Benarasto Allahabad, then up the Yamuna, past Agra to Delhi. But I am very exhausted and homesick;today is the last day of August. Go home, I tell myself: move directly towards home. I enterthe Nepal Airlines office and buy a ticket for tomorrow’s flight.I look at the flute seller standing in a corner of the square near the hotel. In his handis a pole with an attachment at the top from which fifty or sixty bansuris protrude in alldirections, like the quills of a porcupine. They are of bamboo: there are cross-flutes andrecorders. From time to time he stands the pole on the ground, selects a flute and plays fora few minutes. The sound rises clearly above the noise of the traffic and the hawkers’ cries.He plays slowly meditatively, without excessive display. He does not shout out his wares.Occasionally he makes a sale, but in a curiously offhanded way as if this were incidental tohis enterprise. Sometimes he breaks off playing to talk to the fruit seller. I imagine that thishas been the pattern of his life for years.I find it difficult to tear myself away from the square.

They were being paid to do something theyenjoyed!At the end of the first week they knocked at the old man’s house and askedto be paid.He did so.The second week when they asked for payment he said he had run out ofmoney and sent them away with only `15.The third week the man said he had not yet received his pension and gavethem only `10.The boys were very disappointed but there was not much they could doabout it.The fourth week the man said he could not afford to pay them ` 25 as he hadpromised, but would give them ` 5 each week without fail.This was unbearable for the boys.“You expect us to play seven days a week for a measly ` 5!” they yelled.“Go to blazes.”They stormed away and never played on the street again.Unit 2Cricket CommentaryHello, good morning, viewers.

Fora country like ours, Tourism Sector is not only a major contributor to the growth ofthe economy but a generator of employment opportunities as well.The Government primarily plays the role of a facilitator, acting as a catalyst forthe development and promotion of tourism. It is absolutely imperative that we notonly maintain the quality of facilities and services offered, but also bring them at parwith the best in the world.Realizing that development of infrastructure holds the key to the growth oftourism, the Government is investing heavily for integrated development of theInfrastructure Sector. All possible steps are being taken to promote tourism relatedinfrastructure. We are encouraging the Hotel and Travel Industry, developing tourismcircuits, working towards preservation of monuments, human resources development,and, upgradation of information technology.As the minister of tourism, I would like to mention here that, in our effort todevelop and promote tourism, we have also to keep in mind the importance ofsustainable tourism and the need of protecting our environment. India, a region withthe world’s greatest bio–diversity and varied natural locales, is an ideal destinationfor eco-tourism. We recognize the importance of cleanliness, general hygiene andsanitation in making India a memorable tourist destination. In the longer run, thiswould ensure provision of a better quality of life to our own citizens.Domestic tourism is a big contributor to the growth of this sector.

226,,,"173   Appendix IIAbout the Textbook and Assessment Procedures‘Our World through English’ Class IX has been prepared in accordance with thesyllabus for a ten-year course in English as a second  language.Teachers should act as facilitators and encourage children to do  individual andgroup work, in order to make them as autonomous users of the language. Interactiveapproach should be followed while transacting the language activities in each unit.The GoalsAfter the completion of the course, the students are expected to attain the basic proficiency, such as is acquired in natural language learning i.e., thespontaneous and appropriate use of language for at least everyday use, to develop his/her linguistic competence for abstract thought and knowledge acquisition and, to construct discourses (oral and written) such as narratives, descriptions, essays,conversations,  diary, plays,  script writing, profile writing, dramas, posters, slogans,letters, etc.Learning Outcomes / Academic StandardsAt the end of the academic year the children are expected to achieve certain academicstandards. The everyday classroom transaction should focus on the following areas.1. Listening and Speaking2. Reading Comprehension3. Vocabulary4. Grammar5. Conventions of Writing6. Creative Expression (Oral and Written Discourses)In order to achieve the above learning outcomes, the new textbooks have eight unitswith different themes and genres.Features of  the  TextbookThe following are the features of the Textbook: Units are thematically organized with passages meant for listening and reading.  Activitiesfocus on reading comprehension,  vocabulary, grammar and study skills. Measures have been taken to help learners get the rules familiarised with differentgenres  such as narratives, essays, biographical sketches, plays, poems, etc. and constructthem in oral as well as written forms. Though the components in a unit have been organised as listening, speaking (oralactivity), reading and writing, an integrated treatment of these skills has been workedout. Vocabulary and grammar exercises have been contextually designed."
227,,,"174    A few questions and activities, given under comprehension, do not target  any fixedresponses; instead, they demand the learners to use language authentically both  orallyand in writing. These comprehension questions and the language activities are merelystepping stones for the learners to gain proficiency in the  language and as such are notgoals by themselves.Components of a UnitFace Sheet / Trigger: Each unit starts with a picture / quotation / poem followed bysome interactive questions.  This is to warm-up the students and to generate genuineinterest towards the theme and the reading texts in the unit.  The teacher can put morenumber of questions that demand divergent responses from children in order toencourage them to interact more effectively.Reading Texts:  Every unit consists of three reading texts (Reading A, B and C).  Thereading texts include different genres such as stories, narratives, biographical sketches,short plays, speeches, monologues, letters, interviews and essays related to the themeof the unit.  All texts are followed by glossary, and a few comprehension questions.You will find the questions that help students think critically, reflect on what they haveread, and interpret the text in their own words. Teachers should follow the suggestedtransaction process in the classroom.Language ActivitiesVocabulary:  This section contains some vocabulary tasks/activities/exercises. Youwill find matching questions, finding synonyms / antonyms, phrasal verbs, multipleshades of meanings, collocations, homonyms, homophones, homographs, idioms, word-formation activities, etc.Grammar: This section contains some grammar tasks/activities/exercises.  You willfind tasks that make the students explore the language.  You will also find activitiesthat help students identify grammatical errors and edit  them.Writing: This section contains some written discourses that help students writeconversations, descriptions, narratives / stories, messages, e-mails, SMSes, diary entries,letters, paragraph, an essays, biographical sketches, songs / poems and some otherdiscourses.  You will also find some tasks that need group discussion, collation ofinformation from various sources, and then writing a piece collaboratively.Study Skills:  This section contains some tasks/activities/exercises to improve studyskills.  You will find some verbal and nonverbal activities like pie charts, bar diagrams,tables, advertisements, dictionary entries, route maps, etc. These activities  help childreninterprete, analyze and transfer the data, and use the language appropriately.Listening: This section contains a  listening text (given in Appendix-I) and a fewtasks/activities/exercises to improve speaking and listening competencies.  You willfind some listening comprehension questions, and questions that call for the students’reflection on what they have listened to.Oral Activity: This section contains some oral discourses to improve speakingcompetencies.  In this section you will find some oral activities that encourage thechildren to participate in the conversations, discussions, debates, compering, presentingreports,  speeches, etc.Project:  This section contains one or two projects related to the theme of the unit.They require students to find resources, to work out the task i.e. collection, analysisand interpretation of data, to prepare a report and to present their findings before theclass."
228,,,"175   Self -Assessment Checklist: The checklist given at the end of each unit helps thelearner to assess his / her own learning. The self-assessment tools reflect all thesections in a unit. This check list also helps the teacher to assess the learning levelsof children.The AssessmentLanguage learning is a continuous process.  Assessment is not an activity distinctfrom learning. Since learning is facilitated through group discussions, pair discussionsand individually, assessment also operates at the individual level, in peers and in groups.This will help the learners to compare their strengths and weaknesses and makemodifications in their learning. We propose Continuous and Comprehensive Assessmentat all levels of language learning.CCE is an attempt to shift from rote-learning to constructing knowledge andapplying it as and when required. CCE is an ongoing process and is an integral part of thelesson. At every point of classroom transaction, we will have to assess what the child haslearnt for which the same  activities that are used for teaching / learning are used. Thequestions in the examination paper shall not simply be based on information given in thetextbooks but shall create slots for the learner to use language in a meaningful wayapplying what she has learnt. So ‘mugging up’ by the student will not be of any use to himor her.Types of AssessmentThere are two types of assessment.1. Formative Assessment2. Summative AssessmentGuidelines for Formative AssessmentFormative assessment is done based on four tools that cover all the language competencies(Academic Standards). These are:1. Read and Reflect2. Written Works3. Project Work4. Slip TestTeacher has to assess the performance of the learners for each term. 20 marks allottedfor Formative test in which 5 marks are allotted for each tool. This is not a single dayactivity; it is a cumulative account of what has happened in day- to-day class roomtransaction.Criteria for awarding marks under each tool:Read and Reflect : The child has to read one reading text (other than text book) such asstory, news report, article etc. Children have to read, comprehend and express theiropinion in oral and written.  The oral and written reflections are the evidences for awardingmarks.Written Works : This is with regard to: 1. Exercises given in the text book, 2. Discoursesassigned to individuals during classroom transaction. 3. Answers to a few extrapolatingquestions.The facilitator has to go through the written works and award marks based on thechildren’s performance in view of the presentation of their own thoughts with well formedsentences."

Thistest should cover the targeted discourses (by taking two / three targeted discourses  ineach formative assessment). This practice will help children in attempting the writtendiscourses in Summative Tests successfully. The teacher may conduct the slip test for20 marks so as to cover more number of questions.  Finally it has to be reduced to 5marks.Teacher’s unit cum period plan should reflect children’s oral performance.Summative AssessmentThere will be a Summative Assessment after every term. The test is for 100marks. Out of these, 20 marks are allotted for Formative assessment and 80 marks areallotted for written test.The average marks of Formative 1 and 2 should be added to first Summative-I.The average marks of four Formative tests should be added to final Summative-II (Publicexam).As CCE is a school based assessment, every school should prepare their ownquestion papers for summative assessment.There are two papers (Paper-I & II) in Summative -I & II. Each paper carries 40marks.The following are the domains of assessment for both papers.1. Reading comprehension (15 marks)2. Vocabulary & grammar (10 marks)3.
