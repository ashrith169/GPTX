2,,Preface,"The State Council of Educational Research and Training has developed the StateCurriculum Framework - 2011 and Position Papers in tune with the National CurriculumFramework - 2005 and the Right to Education Act - 2009.  Accordingly a new set of textbookshas been designed to be introduced in a phased manner.  In the year 2012-13, the first of thisseries of textbooks has developed for classes I, II, III, VI, and VII. In the year 2013-14 forthe remaining classes IV, V, VIII and IX  textbooks have developed. Practicing teachershave been involved in the production of the textbooks along with the state level and nationallevel experts.Hitherto, English was introduced in Non-English Medium Schools in class III. The StateGovernment introduced English for the first time in class  I in 2011-12 in all Non-EnglishMedium Schools also. In the year 2012-13, English has been introduced  in class II in allNon-English Medium Schools. With this, all classes from I to X will have English as one ofthe subjects, irrespective of the medium of instruction. Therefore, in order to have parityamong students of English and non- English medium, a common English textbook wasintroduced in all media from June 2012. Moreover, since IT enabled learning, multilingualism,and language across the curriculum would greatly enhance the child's learning, it would not bea problem for the non- English medium child to learn English as effectively as the child inEnglish medium does. This single textbook norm is already in practice in many states includingTamilnadu, Bihar, and Kerala. Further, students of all media have a common English Textbookat Intermediate level in our state.This textbook, “Our World through English” class IX,  is an integrated one in thesense it has The Main Reader component, The Supplementary  Reader component and TheWorkbook component interwoven into a single textbook.  Hence, these components arefound in each and every unit.  The language skills  listening, speaking, reading, and writing areintegrated in the larger context of the themes as suggested in NCF - 2005. The activities areso designed as to ensure the holistic treatment of language.Inclusion of Gender Sensitivity and Child Sexual Abuse in School Text Books publishedby School Education Department with support of UNICEF is taken up to ensure protectionof children through various interventions like personal safety rules, gender sensitivity, childsexual abuse, self esteem and life skills. In these areas safety mechanisms and laws related tochild protection are taken care of. Hence, the teachers must know about these things andbring awareness among all the stakeholders.The main aim of teaching English is to help learners evolve themselves as independentusers of English.  I hope this textbook will help teachers and students achieve this by makingthe teaching-learning process effective.I thank all the institutions and experts at the state and national level, the members of theTextbook Production  and Development Committees, the staff members of  the SCERT, T.S.Hyderabad and all others who have contributed directly or indirectly for the successfulproduction of this textbook.Any suggestions for the improvement of this book are welcome.DirectorSCERT., Hyderabad.12-11-2012HyderabadIV"

18,,True Height,"This story talks about the feelings of an athlete as he pursues his dream. Readabout a nerve-wracking day in Michael Stone’s life as he prepares to take the ultimatetest of his sports career. It is an awe-inspiring achievement that will leave you breathless.His palms were sweating. He needed a towel to dry his grip. A glass of ice waterquenched his thirst but hardly cooled his intensity. The astroturf  he sat on was as hot as thecompetition he faced today at the National Junior Olympics. The pole was set at 17 feet.That was three inches higher than his personal best. Michael Stone confronted the mostchallenging day of his pole-vaulting career. The stands were still filled with about twentythousand people, even though the final race had ended an hour earlier.The pole vault is truly the glamorous event of any track and field competition. Thesportsman combines the grace of a gymnast with the strength of a bodybuilder. Pole-vaultingalso has the element of flying, and the thought of flying as high as a two-storeyed buildingis a mere fantasy to anyone watching such an event. Today it is not only Michael Stone’sreality and dream – it is his quest.As long as Michael could remember, he had always dreamed of flying. Michael’smother read him numerous stories about flying when he was growing up. Her stories werealways the ones that described the land from a bird’s-eye view. Her excitement and passionfor details made Michael’s dreams full of colour and beauty. Michael had this one recurringdream. He would be running down a country road. He could feel the rocks and chunks ofdirt at his feet. As he raced down the golden-lined wheat fields, he would always outrun thelocomotives passing by. He would begin soaring like an eagle.Where he flew would always coincide with his mother’s stories. His dad, on the otherhand, was not a dreamer. Bert Stone was a hard-core realist. He believed in hard work andsweat. His motto: If you want something, work for it!From the age of fourteen, Michael did just that. He began a very careful and regimentedweightlifting programme. He worked out every other day with weights, with some kind ofrunning work on alternate days. The programme was carefully monitored by Michael’s coach,trainer and father. Michael’s dedication, determination and discipline was a coach’s dream."
19,,What Is a Player?,"A player is one, who doesn't give up at the sight of defeat,But learns from their mistakes and puts them beneath.A player is one who doesn't give up at the sound of the buzzer,Always giving what they have from one side of the court to the other.A player is one who doesn't whine about their playing time,Because a player knows it's an unacceptable crime.A player is one who practises game-speed,Always keeping in mind that their shots are not guaranteed.A player is one who doesn't settle for anything less,Even knowing, that they're not the best.They will be the ones you see outside practicing,Day or night, rain or shine,They are the ones running on hurt ankles, admitting they’re fine.A player is one, who has a strong, sensible mind,Never pondering about failing, only contemplating prevailing.A player is one who doesn't chicken out,Who wants to be in the game when everything countsNow, that is a true player. - Jessica Taylor"

21,,".V.S. Laxman, Very Very Special","‘Treat success and failure on the same wavelength’“Success and failure are parts of anybody’s life. The key is self-belief andperforming consistently in tough conditions,” V.V.S. Laxman tells V. V. Subrahmanyam.One of the finest players in contemporary cricket has called it a day. For someonewho delighted cricket lovers with his brilliance with the willow for 16 long years in Testcricket, Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman announced his retirement at a crowded mediaconference in Hyderabad, ahead of the two-test series against New Zealand.The 37-year-old star batsman, who was part of the fabulous batting line-up whichhelped India become the No.1 Test team, shares his experiences and thoughts in anexclusive interview with Sportstar.Sportstar: When you look back, how has the journey beenin the world of cricket?V.V.S.Laxman: It has been wonderful. I was lucky that theHyderabad Cricket Association promoted me and Zaki (SyedMoinuddin Zaki) from the under-16 level itself. They madeus play in the under-19 grade the same year. It was a hugeleap for us and very encouraging. Fortunately, by 18, I wason the verge of playing for Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy.Honestly, I feel that all the hard work andcommitment I put in from the start of my career haveculminated in 16 long years of international cricket. It hasbeen an immensely satisfying feeling to have contributed to Indian cricket in myown way.SS :Who has been the biggest influence on you?VVS:My parents (Dr. V. Shantaram and Dr. V. Satyabhama), no doubt about that. Especially,given the fact that sports was never an integral part of our family. But, the guidingphilosophy which they taught was handling success and failure with equal ease."

23,,Swami Is Expelled from School,"The headmaster entered the class with a slightly flushed face and a hard ominous lookin his eyes. Swaminathan wished that he had been anywhere but there at that moment. Theheadmaster surveyed the class for a few minutes and asked, ‘Are you not ashamed of comingand sitting there after what you did yesterday?’ Just as a special honour to them, he read outthe names of a dozen students or so that had attended the class. After that he read out thenames of those that had kept away, and asked them to stand on their benches. He felt thatpunishment was not enough and asked them to stand on their desks. Swaminathan was amongthem and felt humiliated at that eminence. Then they were lectured. When it was over, theywere asked to offer explanations one by one. One said that he had an attack of a  headacheand therefore could not come to school. He was asked to bring a medical certificate.The second said that while he had been coming to school on the previous day, someonehad told him that there would be no school, and he had gone back home. The headmasterreplied that if he was going to listen to every loafer who said there would be no school, hedeserved to be flogged. Anyway, why did he not come to  school and verify? No answer. Thepunishment was pronounced: ten days’ attendance cancelled, two rupees fine, and the wholeday to be spent on the desk. The third said that he had an attack of a headache. The fourthsaid that he had stomach ache. The fifth said that his grandmother died suddenly just as hewas starting for school. The headmaster asked him if he could bring a letter from his father.No. He had no father. Then, who was his guardian? His grandmother. But the grandmotherwas dead, was she not? No. It was another grandmother. The headmaster asked how manygrandmothers a person could have. No answer. Could he bring a letter from his neighbours?No, he could not. None of his neighbours could read or write, because he lived in a veryilliterate part of Ellaman Street. Then the headmaster offered to send a teacher to thisilliterate locality to ascertain from the boy’s neighbours if the death of the grandmotherwas a fact. A pause, some perspiration, and then the answer that the neighbours could notpossibly know anything about it, since the grandmother died in the village. The headmasterhit him on the knuckles with his cane, called him a street dog, and pronounced the punishment:fifteen days suspension.When Swaminathan’s turn came, he looked around helplessly. Rajam sat on the thirdbench in front, and resolutely looked away. He was gazing at the blackboard intently."

He was a poet, playwright, novelist,painter, educator and musician. He translated a collection ofhis poems, ‘Gitanjali’, which was published in 1912. In 1913he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. He is the authorof the Indian National Anthem as well as the National Anthem of Bangladesh."
36,,An Icon of Civil Rights,"Martin Luther King's Acceptance Speech, on the occasion of the award of theNobel Peace Prize in Oslo, December 10, 1964.Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies andGentlemen:          I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at amoment when 22 million Negroes of theUnited States of America are engaged in acreative battle to end the long night of racialinjustice. I accept this award on behalf of acivil rights movement which is moving withdetermination and a majestic scorn for riskand danger to establish a reign of freedom anda rule of justice. I am mindful that onlyyesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, ourchildren, crying out for brotherhood, wereanswered with fire hoses, snarling dogs andeven death. I am mindful that only yesterdayin Philadelphia, Mississippi, young peopleseeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday morethan 40 houses of worship in the state of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned becausethey offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful thatdebilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung ofthe economic ladder.         Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleagueredand committed to unrelenting struggle; to a movement which has not won the very peaceand brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize.After contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of thatmovement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political"

44,,Kathmandu,"I get a cheap room in the centreof town and sleep for hours. The nextmorning, with Mr. Shah’s son and nephew.I visit the two temples in Kathmandu thatare most sacred to the Hindus and theBuddhists.At Pashupathinath (outside whicha sign proclaims ‘Entrance for the Hindusonly’) there is an atmosphere of ‘febrileconfusion’. Priests, hawkers, devotees,tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons and dogsroam through the grounds. We offer a fewflowers. There are so many worshippersthat some people trying to get the priest’sattention are elbowed aside by otherspushing their way to the front. A princessof the Nepalese royal house appears; everyone bows and makes way. By the main gate,a party of saffron – clad Westerners struggle for permission to enter. The policeman is notconvinced that they are ‘the Hindus’ (only the Hindus are allowed to enter the temple). Afight breaks out between two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps onto a shivalinga,then runs screaming around the temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati that flowsbelow.

A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the river bank.When it emerges fully, the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period of the Kaliyugwill end on earth.At the Boudhanath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of Kathmandu, there is, in contrast, asense of stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a road. Small shops stand on itsouter edge; many of these are owned by Tibetan immigrants; felt bags, Tibetan prints andsilver jewellery can be bought here.
